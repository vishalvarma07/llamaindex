            "Description & specs When it comes to versatility and modular capabilities, the BANISH 30 can’t be beat. Recently reviewed in a featured editorial article in the NRA’s American Rifleman magazine , it works with your rimfire and rifle calibers from .17 to .300 Weatherby and can be configured in two different lengths. All BANISH suppressors have been designed for unmatched sound suppression. (After all, the whole point is to reduce sound!) Internal testing shows that BANISH 30 reduces the report of a .308 by a whopping 34 decibels at a minimum. The BANISH 30 comes as a 9-inch suppressor holding eight baffles, but if you’ll be shooting suppressed in tighter, confined spaces or hunting blinds, it can easily break down and assemble into a 7-inch configuration with six baffles. This suppressor also weighs considerably less than most suppressors of similar size. This is because the BANISH 30 – like all of the other BANISH suppressors in the lineup – is made from a strong titanium alloy for unmatched durability at an extremely light weight. In the full configuration, it weighs 14 ounces; in the short configuration, it weighs just 11 ounces. You’ll be hard pressed to even feel it on your gun! Unlike comparable models from competitors, the BANISH 30 is completely user-serviceable. It easily comes apart for cleaning in a tumbler, ultrasonic cleaner, or manually. Reassembly is a breeze due to the baffles being keyed and indexed for alignment. Perfect for target practice, competitive shooting, or in the field while big game hunting, the BANISH 30 will reduce the sound signature and mitigate some of the recoil on your rifle. All silencers require the purchase of a $200 Federal Tax Stamp . Length: 7” or 9” (depending on whether the tube extension is on or not) Diameter: 1-1/2” Number of Baffles: 8 Weight: 11.2 oz (7”) or 14.3 oz (9”) Material: Titanium Thread Pitch: 5/8×24 Brand: BANISH Self-Service: Yes Caliber: .308/7.62 Caliber Range: .17 to .300 Weatherby Color: Black Finish: Gun Kote and Tribodone 41 DLC Sound Reduction: 34 dB Mount Style: Direct Thread Full-Auto Rated: Limited Full-Auto Rated Lifetime Warranty: Yes Download Spec Sheet Download Instruction Manual",
            "Features Features Tested #1 in sound reduction! In testing, BANISH proved to be the most effective suppressor in reducing the report of a firearm, reducing the sound of a .308 by more than 34 db!

Multi-caliber design All BANISH suppressors accommodate calibers that are smaller in diameter than marked. Made in USA 100% made and assembled in the United States. Can-clean™ technology Suppressors get dirty, that is just a fact of suppressor use.

This isn’t a problem with BANISH CanClean technology. No special tools are required to take your BANISH Suppressor apart, making this one of the fastest cleaning suppressors on the market today. Stifle™ baffles A truly universal baffle stack, these baffles are used in all BANISH suppressors and can be reassembled in any order. This user-friendly design allows for the shooter to quickly clean and put their BANISH Suppressor back together, or reconfigure the suppressor length with minimal effort.

            "Description & specs Designed for smaller, centerfire calibers used by predator hunters and target shooters, the BANISH 223 will fit all rifles .224 and smaller, including rimfire rifles. (You should, however, look into a dedicated rimfire suppressor, like the BANISH 22. ) The AR15 has quickly become one of the most popular rifles on the market, and the BANISH 223 suppressor is optimized to run on that platform as well, not just traditional bolt-action hunting and target rifles. As an added perk, it’s even rated for limited full-auto fire. With a sound reduction of 34 decibels, the reduced report provided by the BANISH 223’s expansion tube and seven baffles will not only protect your hearing but also the hearing of anyone shooting around you, and it will help keep the sound from spooking other animals. The BANISH 223 is a direct-thread silencer that mounts on conventional 1/2×28 threads. Made of lightweight titanium, this 7” suppressor weighs a mere 11.4 ounces. While centerfire rounds are generally jacketed, buildup of the copper jackets in the baffles still occurs. Since there is more power (and powder) behind centerfire rounds, there is greater carbon buildup than from rimfire rounds. Like all suppressors in the BANISH lineup, the BANISH 223 is easily disassembled for cleaning and maintenance. Use a tumbler, ultrasonic cleaner, or a nylon brush; the method of cleaning is up to you. The seven baffles are designed to easily stack and index in any order, making reassembly a breeze.

            "FAQs Are BANISH suppressors good? Yes, BANISH suppressors are among the quietest and most high-quality suppressors on the market. Sure, we might be a little biased. But you can’t blame us for being proud. BANISH suppressors were the first multi-caliber silencers out there on the market. You don’t have to buy a suppressor for every gun in your safe. Rather, you can buy one (or maybe two, if it’s a holiday) BANISH suppressor to fit all of them. A single BANISH 30 can work any rifle caliber from .22 to .308 by simply changing the front end-caps. We put 27 silencers to the test, and the BANISH 30 came was second only to the Yankee Hill Machine Resonator. The YMH Resonator is a quality silencer, but the advantage of the BANISH is that it can also come apart to clean. Can I Use a .30 Caliber Silencer on All Sub Calibers? Yes! Doing so is very common with a stacked baffle design, like the BANISH 30 . Having one silencer for all rifle applications doesn’t often impact performance because .308 silencers are longer with additional baffles. Due to its light weight, titanium is one of the most popular materials for application on all sub calibers. Please note that not all .308 silencers work well on a .223. Stack baffle design is typically best for dual application because there is a greater surface area to remove heat from the blast. In recent tests, we found that our own exclusive silencer, the BANISH 30 , was quieter on a .223 than a .223 silencer was. Additionally, we have tested some silencers that are not hearing safe on all sub-calibers. As such, it’s best to ask our staff if you have a specific question about certain models. Can I use one silencer for multiple firearms? Yes. Buy one silencer and you can use it on all guns of smaller caliber. For example, if you bought the Banish 30 Multi-Caliber Suppressor , it will work with all of your rifle calibers from .17 to .30 caliber magnums How long does it take to get a tax stamp for a BANISH suppressor? As a ballpark estimate, it could take anywhere from 30 days (if you e-file an ATF Form 1), to 12 months (if you e-file an ATF Form 3 ). But how long it actually takes to get a tax stamp will depend on a few key factors. First, which form are you using to register your silencer? If you are buying your suppressor from an FFL dealer or someone selling their own suppressor, you can register it with an ATF Form 4. If you are registering a homemade silencer, you need to use an ATF Form 1. Second, it will depend on if you file your form digitally, as an e-file, or send in a paper form in the mail. Like most things these days, you can anticipate an e-file being processed faster than the paper copy. Third, it will depend on if you have registered your silencer as an individual or as an NFA gun trust. Check out our full guide to getting a suppressor tax stamp for more information.

            "Description & specs The BANISH® Speed K is a 5.56 caliber suppressor set to revolutionize the suppressor industry. With clipped-wall baffles and a finned blast chamber, the Speed K ensures maximum sound reduction while maintaining optimal performance. Featuring controlled flow technology and a vented 4th baffle, this duty suppressor minimizes gas blowback for a better shooting experience. The design allows for only a 5.8% increase in blowback from unsuppressed shooting, enabling rifles to function smoothly without additional modification. Designed in partnership with Federal Ammunition and law enforcement professionals, the Speed K was built for those in uniform who demand excellence from their equipment. The silencer is constructed with 100% Inconel for durability and lower heat retention. Passing seven rounds of SOCOM testing, the Speed K is extremely durable and won’t fail when it matters most. One round of SOCOM testing puts 1,440 rounds through the suppressor in a short period. Many suppressors don’t pass one round of SOCOM testing, let alone seven rounds! At 4 inches in length, the Speed K is the perfect choice when maneuverability and speed are vital to a successful mission. The compact design allows for quick and precise movements in tight spaces. Creating a suppressor short in length was a primary focus when designing and building the Speed K, along with minimal blowback and extreme durability. The BANISH Speed K comes with a direct thread Industry Standard Hub mount. Muzzle brake devices are also available for purchase. The 1.375×24 HUB mount allows purchasers to attach a separate quick-detach mount. If your mission is silence, trust what the pros trust and equip your rifles with the BANISH Speed K.

All for free. Does a silencer count as barrel length? No, a silencer does not count as barrel length. A silencer will only count towards barrel length if it has been permanently pinned and welded on. There is not a good reason to attach a silencer permanently, since it reduces its usability and makes it harder to clean. The only real reason to do so is to lengthen your gun’s barrel in order to avoid buying a SBR tax stamp. But usually, the cost to safely affix a silencer permanently is more than the cost of the stamp. Can you put a silencer on a rifle? Absolutely. In fact, rifles are by far the most common type of firearm on which to mount a silencer. Like rifles, silencers are common among hunters. Your hunting rifle should definitely have a silencer, because first and foremost, they reduce noise pollution. Meaning you’re not going to scare off every critter in a 10 mile radius. But silencers also reduce recoil, muzzle blast, and the risk of hearing damage. They also are known to increase accuracy, helping you make that once-in-a-lifetime shot. Some rifles can also be integrally suppressed to reduce noise even more. They also have important safety benefits, like allowing you to be more aware of your surroundings. Without having to wear hearing protection, you can listen for sounds of other predators or hunters. Are .223/5.56 silencers illegal? No, .223/5.56 silencers are not illegal. You can very legally purchase and own a silencer in 42 of our 50 U.S. states. (If you are hoping to buy one in California, Illinois, New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Delaware, Hawaii, or Washington D.C. you would be out of luck!) If you are in the 42 states that have legalized silencers, you can trust that Silencer Central is there with you. We are licensed in all of those 42 states.

            "Description & specs The BANISH 45 is a modular silencer specifically designed for handguns and pistol caliber carbines in calibers ranging from .45 ACP down to rimfire. Testing shows the BANISH 45 suppresses a 9mm pistol by 36 decibels – far more sound reduction than the competition. Made with Titanium for the ultimate combination of durability and weight reduction, the BANISH 45 is the lightest in its class at a mere 9.6oz in the short configuration of 6.7”. You can also run it in the long configuration of 8.6” and still barely notice it’s on your gun because it weighs only 11 oz. Because of the BANISH 45’s modular design, you can run it with eight or 12 baffles, depending on your specific needs. Ideal for 3-gun or target shooting, the BANISH 45 will help protect the hearing of the shooter and others in a shooting competition and reduce recoil for quicker second shot target acquisition. User-serviceable from both ends, this suppressor can be easily and quickly disassembled for configuration changes and cleaning. You can easily clean the baffles by hand with a brush and your favorite solvent. Reassembly is just as easy, thanks to the keyed and indexed baffles. This guarantees that each one will be lined up perfectly for optimum performance. The unique design of the BANISH 45 makes it the one suppressor to fit any pistol caliber gun. Simply swap out the pistons (sold separately) and you can attach this suppressor to any multitude of pistols or pistol caliber carbines in your collection.

            "Description & specs The BANISH 22 suppressor is designed for use with rimfire pistols and rifles chambered in .22 caliber and smaller. This includes .22 Hornet, .17HMR, and even 5.7×28. It’s even rated for full-auto! Using 1/2×28 threads for direct attachment, the BANISH 22 is made of lightweight titanium, weighs just 4.1oz, is 1” in diameter, and only 5 ⅜” long. This means you’ll barely even notice that the BANISH 22 is on the end of your gun – except when it comes to sound reduction. Tests have shown that the BANISH 22 brings the sound down to about 120 decibels, making it barely louder than a BB-gun. Essentially, this is as close to “Hollywood quiet” as you can get. The Banish 22 at the muzzle tested at 116.8 dB on a 22LR with a 16″ barrel and 117.6 dB at the muzzle on a Ruger Mark IV. Since rimfire ammo uses projectiles that are not jacketed, lead buildup and carbon fouling are a real concern in a rimfire silencer. Over time without cleaning, it’s possible for a .22 suppressor to completely fill with lead and carbon, rendering it ineffective for sound suppression and adding considerable weight. The BANISH 22 was designed specifically to maximize your time shooting and minimize your time cleaning. Inside the tube are eight baffles that are engineered for a precise fit to keep lead debris and carbon buildup at an absolute minimum. This prevents the debris and buildup from reaching the tube, which causes components to fuse together. Once disassembled, cleaning couldn’t be simpler: toss the baffles in a tumbler, ultrasonic cleaner, or use good, old-fashioned elbow grease. With indexing lines on each baffle for easy realignment and reassembly, the BANISH 22 is the only rimfire silencer on the market that is user-serviceable from both ends. If you’re looking for the perfect first-time silencer purchase, the BANISH 22 is a great option. It’s ideal for varmint shooting, small game hunting, target practice, and more.

            "Description & specs The two most important factors for picking a suppressor for a backcountry hunt are sound suppression and weight, and the .30 caliber Banish Backcountry suppressor was built with those factors in mind. The entire Banish lineup prides itself on being quiet and lightweight, but the Backcountry recently reviewed on AllOutdoor.com takes things to a different level. You get the same unmatched sound suppression and durable titanium construction as the flagship Banish 30 suppressor, but in a package that’s shorter and lighter than ever before. The Backcountry is a fixed-length suppressor that measures 5.5” in length (5.7 with mount) and weighs just 7.8 ounces. That’s a full 1.3” shorter and 2.2 ounces lighter than the Banish 30 in its short configuration. That may not sound like much, but it makes a world of difference for backcountry adventurers who carefully pack their gear with size and weight in mind. Rated for calibers up to the .300 Remington Ultra Magnum (RUM), the Banish Backcountry utilizes six baffles that drop the decibel level down to 135 dB for .308 Winchester, 137 dB for .300 Win Mag, and 138 dB for .300 RUM at the ear – all of which fall below the hearing-safe threshold. Utilizing a 1.375×24 Universal Mount, the Banish Backcountry is a direct-thread suppressor designed to eliminate any extra weight associated with a muzzle device method of attachment, but it is also available with an optional muzzle brake attachment. When size, weight, and sound suppression are of the utmost concern, the Banish Backcountry suppressor allows you to pack in ounces, shoot at hearing-safe levels, and pack out pounds. All silencers require the purchase of a $200 Federal Tax Stamp.

            "Description & specs The newest addition to the BANISH line of suppressors is the BUCK 30, a high-performance hunting suppressor in partnership with Buck Commander. Buck Commander is all about the thrill of the hunt and the relationships that come with it. Silencer Central is all about making your silencer purchase process as simple and hassle-free as possible so that you can spend more time thinking about your next hunt. The BUCK 30 is a multi-caliber suppressor that works with all rifle calibers up to .300 Winchester Magnum. That makes it the perfect choice for all of your hunting adventures no matter how big or small. Made of stainless steel and laser welded for precision and durability, the BUCK 30 features the Buck Commander logo proudly displayed on its tubeless construction. At just 6.9” in length and 1.54” in diameter, it weighs only 13.8 oz. Equipped with an accuracy baffle, the BUCK 30 minimizes point of impact shift so you may only need to make slight sight adjustments when you switch between suppressed and unsuppressed shooting. Additionally, the BUCK 30 features an industry-standard hub mount giving users more options to connect their BUCK 30 to their host firearm. Despite the compact size, it packs an impressive amount of sound suppression. Tests show that a .308 from an 18” barrel registers 131 decibels at the ear. Similarly, 6.5 Creedmoor from a 20” barrel registers 132 decibels at the ear. Both are well under the hearing-safe limit of 140 decibels. If you want to reduce your recoil, save your hearing, improve your accuracy, and protect your hunt, then you need the BUCK 30 on your rifle the next time you adventure beyond the pavement. All silencers require the purchase of a $200 Federal Tax Stamp.

            "FAQs What’s the Silencer Buying Process Like? Buying a silencer can be an intimidating task. Dealing with the government and their seemingly constantly changing laws is enough to discourage even the most savvy shooting enthusiast. Silencer Central makes it simple to own a silencer. We do all the work for you and make it as easy as 1-2-3. Select your silencer – We offer the best brands and can help you choose the silencer that’s right for you. We do the paperwork – We will manage the entire buying process for you, let you pay for your silencer in installments and even set up a free NFA Gun Trust that allows others to use your silencer. Direct-to-your-door shipping – Once approved, we will ship you new silencer directly to your door. Are .308 suppressors illegal? No! .308 suppressors are legal in 42 states. Suppressors are only illegal in California, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, and Washington D.C. If you want to know more about the specific regulations on silencers in your state, read our state-by-state guide on silencer ownership. Silencers actually make guns safer by reducing the risk of hearing loss and making it possible to operate guns without earplugs. In this way, gun owners can be more aware and responsive to their surroundings. Suppressors are regulated, though, and that process can be a little daunting, even to the most seasoned gun-enthusiast. After all, most of us would rather be out on the range or hunting in the woods than sitting in front of a mountain of paperwork. Silencer Central is here to help navigate the paperwork, gun trust setup , wait time , and the entire buying process from start to finish. What makes Silencer Central different from other companies that sell Silencers online? Ten reasons to buy your silencer from Silencer Central! Select your silencer – We were the first silencer reseller and have been making silencer buying super simple since 2005!. Silencers are all we do – We are not a gun shop that sells silencers on the side like virtually everyone else. Talk to an expert – We have a full-time staff dedicated to making sure your silencer buying experience goes without a hitch. And, if there is ever an issue, you’ll always be able to talk directly to a silencer buying expert. Direct-to-your-door shipping – We have satellite locations in all 42 states where silencers are legal which allow us to deliver your new silencer directly to your door. States include: AL , AK , AZ , AR , CO , CT , FL , GA , IA , ID , KS , KY , LA , MD , ME , MI , MN , MO , MS , MT , ND , NE , NH , NM , NV , NC , OH , OK , OR , PA , SC , SD , TN , TX , UT , VA , VT , WA , WI , WV , & WY . Free NFA Gun Trust – We offer a free NFA Gun Trust (a $250 value) to all customers which essentially establishes a joint ownership scenario in which you can legally share your silencer with designated others (as well as determining who will inherit your silencer). This lets others use your silencer. Pay just 25% down – Our eZ-Pay Interest-Free Layaway Plan allows you to “pay for it while you wait for it”. Submitting your down payment of 25% allows us to file your transfer paperwork with the ATF while you pay off your balance over three months. And we do not charge you any interest! Barrel threading – In the event you need you rifle barrel threaded to accept your new silencer, we will take care of that as well through our Threading Central . We know the game – We are the only silencer reseller on the ATF advisory board which means we not only know the rules and the ropes but we influence them as well. Security – We know you are entrusting us with sensitive information and we are set up to protect it better than any gun shop. We also keep your trust and fingerprint records on file which allows you to streamline the process if you ever choose to buy another silencer. Shopping protection – Finally, buy from Silencer Central and you automatically get the Norton Shopping Guarantee which gives you identity theft protection, dispute resolution, and a lowest price guarantee. All for free. Can you put a suppressor on a non-threaded barrel? Yes, you can put a suppressor on a non-threaded barrel, although it can be a little tricky. Most suppressors are made for a threaded barrel, so you’ll need to find a different way to attach it. There are threading adapters on the market, but the best way to attach a silencer to a non-threaded barrel is to get your barrel threaded. Here at Silencer Central, we have our own threading service, where you can send us your barrel and get it threaded starting at $99.99. Can a .308 suppressor be used on .223? Technically it can, but it’s a little more complicated than that. If the suppressor can handle the shot’s pressure and the bullet can fit through the silencer’s bore, it can work. In most cases, a .308 silencer can then be used on a 223, since that is the case. However, you won’t get the same quality or performance as you would when using a multi-caliber silencer, like the BANISH 30 , or a suppressor designed for a 223. In other words, a .308 suppressor won’t silence a .223 as much as a .223 suppressor would."

The Salvo 12 is designed to operate with nearly all shotguns and ammunition on the market today including pump actions, semi autos, and inertia driven models. Due to the modularity of the Salvo 12, the shooter can remove sections to balance their sound suppression, weight, and length needs and can attach the Salvo to their favorite shotgun with choke mounts available in improved cylinder, modified, improved modified, and full. This adaptability makes the Salvo 12 ideal for use with sporting clays, waterfowl, turkey hunting, home defense, and everything in between. At its full length of 12 inches, sound is brought down to 136.8 dB at the muzzle — well below the 140 dB hearing-safe threshold set by OSHA. Pair this sound reduction with a noticeable decrease in felt recoil, and after just a few rounds through the Salvo 12, you’ll never go back to shooting unsuppressed again. Attaches via choke mount to most commercially available gas operated, inertia driven, or pump action shotguns with barrels threaded for chokes. Modular design allow the user to shorten the silencer to 6″, 8″, or 10″ configurations to balance size, weight, and sound requirements. Rate for wadded shells up to 3″ including buckshot and slugs. Can be shortened to 8″ configuration and remain hearing safe at the ear. Noticeably reduces felt recoil.

This perfectly-engineered marvel includes a key element no other suppressor has ever incorporated: its own auxiliary two-port muzzle brake which reduces the recoil of suppressed fire. When minimal visible signature is required, the bolted-on auxiliary muzzle brake can be easily removed. The Barrett QDL Suppressor’s dual layered tube is constructed of heat treated high strength alloys. This, combined with redundant 360 degree welding, makes it the safest large bore suppressor on the market. By simply sliding the Suppressor over the muzzle brake directly into the indexing point, proper alignment is guaranteed every time. Once in place, the Barrett unique lock-ring coupler clicks into ratchet grooves for a secure fit that nothing can shake.

The Sierra is used extensively by law enforcement, military and other serious shooter communities. Our Sierra suppressor has been an outstanding rock star in the shooting world. We have received numerous reports from many sources stating that our .338 Lapua Sierra suppressor is much quieter than other manufacturers’ .308 suppressors. Thread: Most common is 5/8″ X 24 tpi, but many other thread patterns available. Using the described procedure for measuring sound, the actual sound pressure level reductions and specifications of our sound suppressor models are presented below. All Arabic numeral “1” sound suppressors are specifically designed for law enforcement and military tactical applications. Users frequently complain about a change of the point of impact between a rifle with and without a sound suppressor installed. This is most often a function of the inherent stiffness of the rifle’s barrel, not the sound suppressor. We offer the service or will instruct the customer in how to time out the suppressor to the weapon. This procedure will minimize the change of windage point of impact.

Made for bolt action, non-semi automatic 50 BMG rifles. This suppressor is not suitable for the Barrett semi-auto M82A1, M107, or M107A1. The AR50 uses the factory brake collar to attach and time this suppressor. For light weight .50cal rifles (such as the Barrett 99), user will feel a slight increase in felt recoil. .50cal suppressor can be used on the EDM ARMS M96 408cal. For .50 caliber bolt action rifles and depending upon an individual shooter’s experience, perceived recoil for suppressors is slightly more than with a muzzle brake. The actual visual of the flash signature from a suppressor at 50 yards and forward of the muzzle at a 45° angle is approximately the same as the striking of a BIC lighter. Thread: 1×14 or 7/8×14 Both the shooter and observer will be please with the sound reduction when the Alpha suppressor is in use. However, the sound you will be hearing is still above the safe hearing threshold. It is highly recommended that some type of hearing protection is used when firing the weapon.

We started with aircraft grade billet.  Taking a solid piece of metal and machining a silencer.  No entrance cap, it is an integral part of the suppressor.  No spacers, they are machined into the suppressor body. Changing the outward appearance by adding spiral flutes to aid in cooling and to make this suppressor look like one “bad dude”.  Stainless steel thread inserts. There were, however, a few things we wanted to keep.  We use our tried and true V-Tech baffle and like all Coastal Gun Suppressors built over the past 20 years these units are never sealed.  There are two X project suppressors and both are built for multiple caliber use.

One of the main drawbacks to shooting a semi-auto rifle with a suppressor is the gas blowback that can hit the shooter in the face. Instead of relying on special charging handles or other products to mitigate the issue, the SilencerCo Velos LBP (Low Back-Pressure) was designed for optimal performance from a 5.56mm suppressor. Incorporating state-of-the-art manufacturing processes, such as a 3D-printed Inconel, the core of the Velos LBP is fully welded to the 17-4 front and rear modules. Coming in at just 5.98” long and weighing 15.2 ounces, there’s nothing else like it on the market today. Equipped with a Hoplon blast baffle, no barrel length restrictions, and a full-auto rating, the Velos LBP is the most durable suppressor SilencerCo has ever made. Pair it with existing SilencerCo Charlie accessories and you’re ready to shoot with less back pressure. All silencers require the purchase of a $200 Federal Tax Stamp.

This robust 6.9” long and 1.5″ diameter suppressor is made from 100% hardened 17-4 PH Stainless Steel which makes it able to withstand any environmental conditions you may find yourself in at 19 ounces when paired with its mount. The QUELL fixed baffle stack boasts impressive sound signature reduction, along with the high heat tolerance required for contemporary service carbines and precision rifle platforms that fire a large number of rounds. This durable construction allows it to be used in full-auto rifles, supersonic rifles with pistol barrels, as well as magnum caliber bolt guns – making it an ideal choice for any hard-use suppressor solution. Installing the QUELL “K-mount” muzzle interface is a breeze since all you need is a 7/8” 12-point socket wrench. Once your suppressor has been removed, the black nitride-finished “K-Mount” will minimize flash similar to an M16A1 flash hider. With this easy installation process and impressive results, it’s no wonder why so many are turning to the K Mount for their needs. Make sure to select the appropriate size from our drop-down menu when ordering your Quell Suppressor. Crafted with a heat-resistant Armor Tuff™ finish and available in numerous color options, the QUELL from Wilson Combat will revolutionize service rifles or sporting rifle suppression.

            "Description & specs Our patented zero baffle design breaks the mold of traditional 9mm suppressors. Introducing the first of its kind, Vanquish integrally suppressed rifle. No need to spend top dollar on ammo as the Vanquish was created to shoot even the cheapest ammunition and still sound incredible. Thanks to a ported barrel design, the sonic crack of 115-grain ammo is eliminated, resulting in a shot that sounds just as good as heavy-grain subs. Already shooting subsonic ammunition? We’ve made the ported barrel adjustable, allowing you to close the ports and preserve the velocity of the ammunition. The Vanquish requires virtually zero maintenance. Simply wipe down the outside of the barrel and run a cleaning patch down the inside of the barrel. That’s it. The Vanquish comes in two lengths, a full-size 16” rifle configuration, and a 10.5” short barrel version, and is compatible with any Mil-Spec upper receiver and AR-15 handguard that has an inside diameter of 1.6” or larger.
