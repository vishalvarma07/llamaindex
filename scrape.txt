  - Description & specs When it comes to versatility and modular capabilities, the BANISH 30 can’t be beat. Recently reviewed in a featured editorial article in the NRA’s American Rifleman magazine , it works with your rimfire and rifle calibers from .17 to .300 Weatherby and can be configured in two different lengths. All BANISH suppressors have been designed for unmatched sound suppression. (After all, the whole point is to reduce sound!) Internal testing shows that BANISH 30 reduces the report of a .308 by a whopping 34 decibels at a minimum. The BANISH 30 comes as a 9-inch suppressor holding eight baffles, but if you’ll be shooting suppressed in tighter, confined spaces or hunting blinds, it can easily break down and assemble into a 7-inch configuration with six baffles. This suppressor also weighs considerably less than most suppressors of similar size. This is because the BANISH 30 – like all of the other BANISH suppressors in the lineup – is made from a strong titanium alloy for unmatched durability at an extremely light weight. In the full configuration, it weighs 14 ounces; in the short configuration, it weighs just 11 ounces. You’ll be hard pressed to even feel it on your gun! Unlike comparable models from competitors, the BANISH 30 is completely user-serviceable. It easily comes apart for cleaning in a tumbler, ultrasonic cleaner, or manually. Reassembly is a breeze due to the baffles being keyed and indexed for alignment. Perfect for target practice, competitive shooting, or in the field while big game hunting, the BANISH 30 will reduce the sound signature and mitigate some of the recoil on your rifle. All silencers require the purchase of a $200 Federal Tax Stamp . Length: 7” or 9” (depending on whether the tube extension is on or not) Diameter: 1-1/2” Number of Baffles: 8 Weight: 11.2 oz (7”) or 14.3 oz (9”) Material: Titanium Thread Pitch: 5/8×24 Brand: BANISH Self-Service: Yes Caliber: .308/7.62 Caliber Range: .17 to .300 Weatherby Color: Black Finish: Gun Kote and Tribodone 41 DLC Sound Reduction: 34 dB Mount Style: Direct Thread Full-Auto Rated: Limited Full-Auto Rated Lifetime Warranty: Yes Download Spec Sheet Download Instruction Manual
  - Features Features Tested #1 in sound reduction! In testing, BANISH proved to be the most effective suppressor in reducing the report of a firearm, reducing the sound of a .308 by more than 34 db! Suppresses recoil as well as sound The internal baffles handle the gas in such a way that the suppressor significantly reduces recoil as well as sound. Multi-caliber design All BANISH suppressors accommodate calibers that are smaller in diameter than marked. Made in USA 100% made and assembled in the United States. Can-clean™ technology Suppressors get dirty, that is just a fact of suppressor use. However, suppressors that cannot be easily cleaned quickly build up lead and powder residue, which increases their weight and decreases their performance. This isn’t a problem with BANISH CanClean technology. No special tools are required to take your BANISH Suppressor apart, making this one of the fastest cleaning suppressors on the market today. Stifle™ baffles A truly universal baffle stack, these baffles are used in all BANISH suppressors and can be reassembled in any order. This user-friendly design allows for the shooter to quickly clean and put their BANISH Suppressor back together, or reconfigure the suppressor length with minimal effort. Whispertech™ tube Our unique Whisper Tech tube is where the BANISH multi-caliber system starts. Made of a lightweight titanium alloy, the 9” tube can be shortened to 7” where a shorter, lighter suppressor is desired. 100% titanium Made from an extremely sturdy titanium alloy, BANISH weighs only 13 oz (in the 9” configuration), yet is tough enough for years of service to a frequent shooter.

  - Description & specs Designed for smaller, centerfire calibers used by predator hunters and target shooters, the BANISH 223 will fit all rifles .224 and smaller, including rimfire rifles. (You should, however, look into a dedicated rimfire suppressor, like the BANISH 22. ) The AR15 has quickly become one of the most popular rifles on the market, and the BANISH 223 suppressor is optimized to run on that platform as well, not just traditional bolt-action hunting and target rifles. As an added perk, it’s even rated for limited full-auto fire. With a sound reduction of 34 decibels, the reduced report provided by the BANISH 223’s expansion tube and seven baffles will not only protect your hearing but also the hearing of anyone shooting around you, and it will help keep the sound from spooking other animals. The BANISH 223 is a direct-thread silencer that mounts on conventional 1/2×28 threads. Made of lightweight titanium, this 7” suppressor weighs a mere 11.4 ounces. While centerfire rounds are generally jacketed, buildup of the copper jackets in the baffles still occurs. Since there is more power (and powder) behind centerfire rounds, there is greater carbon buildup than from rimfire rounds. Like all suppressors in the BANISH lineup, the BANISH 223 is easily disassembled for cleaning and maintenance. Use a tumbler, ultrasonic cleaner, or a nylon brush; the method of cleaning is up to you. The seven baffles are designed to easily stack and index in any order, making reassembly a breeze.

  - FAQs Are BANISH suppressors good? Yes, BANISH suppressors are among the quietest and most high-quality suppressors on the market. Sure, we might be a little biased. But you can’t blame us for being proud. BANISH suppressors were the first multi-caliber silencers out there on the market. You don’t have to buy a suppressor for every gun in your safe. Rather, you can buy one (or maybe two, if it’s a holiday) BANISH suppressor to fit all of them. A single BANISH 30 can work any rifle caliber from .22 to .308 by simply changing the front end-caps. We put 27 silencers to the test, and the BANISH 30 came was second only to the Yankee Hill Machine Resonator. The YMH Resonator is a quality silencer, but the advantage of the BANISH is that it can also come apart to clean. Can I Use a .30 Caliber Silencer on All Sub Calibers? Yes! Doing so is very common with a stacked baffle design, like the BANISH 30 . Having one silencer for all rifle applications doesn’t often impact performance because .308 silencers are longer with additional baffles. Due to its light weight, titanium is one of the most popular materials for application on all sub calibers. Please note that not all .308 silencers work well on a .223. Stack baffle design is typically best for dual application because there is a greater surface area to remove heat from the blast. In recent tests, we found that our own exclusive silencer, the BANISH 30 , was quieter on a .223 than a .223 silencer was. Additionally, we have tested some silencers that are not hearing safe on all sub-calibers. As such, it’s best to ask our staff if you have a specific question about certain models. Can I use one silencer for multiple firearms? Yes. Buy one silencer and you can use it on all guns of smaller caliber. For example, if you bought the Banish 30 Multi-Caliber Suppressor , it will work with all of your rifle calibers from .17 to .30 caliber magnums How long does it take to get a tax stamp for a BANISH suppressor? As a ballpark estimate, it could take anywhere from 30 days (if you e-file an ATF Form 1), to 12 months (if you e-file an ATF Form 3 ). But how long it actually takes to get a tax stamp will depend on a few key factors. First, which form are you using to register your silencer? If you are buying your suppressor from an FFL dealer or someone selling their own suppressor, you can register it with an ATF Form 4. If you are registering a homemade silencer, you need to use an ATF Form 1. Second, it will depend on if you file your form digitally, as an e-file, or send in a paper form in the mail. Like most things these days, you can anticipate an e-file being processed faster than the paper copy. Third, it will depend on if you have registered your silencer as an individual or as an NFA gun trust. Check out our full guide to getting a suppressor tax stamp for more information.

  - Description & specs The BANISH® Speed K is a 5.56 caliber suppressor set to revolutionize the suppressor industry. With clipped-wall baffles and a finned blast chamber, the Speed K ensures maximum sound reduction while maintaining optimal performance. Featuring controlled flow technology and a vented 4th baffle, this duty suppressor minimizes gas blowback for a better shooting experience. The design allows for only a 5.8% increase in blowback from unsuppressed shooting, enabling rifles to function smoothly without additional modification. Designed in partnership with Federal Ammunition and law enforcement professionals, the Speed K was built for those in uniform who demand excellence from their equipment. The silencer is constructed with 100% Inconel for durability and lower heat retention. Passing seven rounds of SOCOM testing, the Speed K is extremely durable and won’t fail when it matters most. One round of SOCOM testing puts 1,440 rounds through the suppressor in a short period. Many suppressors don’t pass one round of SOCOM testing, let alone seven rounds! At 4 inches in length, the Speed K is the perfect choice when maneuverability and speed are vital to a successful mission. The compact design allows for quick and precise movements in tight spaces. Creating a suppressor short in length was a primary focus when designing and building the Speed K, along with minimal blowback and extreme durability. The BANISH Speed K comes with a direct thread Industry Standard Hub mount. Muzzle brake devices are also available for purchase. The 1.375×24 HUB mount allows purchasers to attach a separate quick-detach mount. If your mission is silence, trust what the pros trust and equip your rifles with the BANISH Speed K. All silencers require the purchase of a $200 Federal Tax Stamp.

There is not a good reason to attach a silencer permanently, since it reduces its usability and makes it harder to clean. The only real reason to do so is to lengthen your gun’s barrel in order to avoid buying a SBR tax stamp. But usually, the cost to safely affix a silencer permanently is more than the cost of the stamp. Can you put a silencer on a rifle? Absolutely. In fact, rifles are by far the most common type of firearm on which to mount a silencer. Like rifles, silencers are common among hunters. Your hunting rifle should definitely have a silencer, because first and foremost, they reduce noise pollution. Meaning you’re not going to scare off every critter in a 10 mile radius. But silencers also reduce recoil, muzzle blast, and the risk of hearing damage. They also are known to increase accuracy, helping you make that once-in-a-lifetime shot. Some rifles can also be integrally suppressed to reduce noise even more. They also have important safety benefits, like allowing you to be more aware of your surroundings. Without having to wear hearing protection, you can listen for sounds of other predators or hunters. Are .223/5.56 silencers illegal? No, .223/5.56 silencers are not illegal. You can very legally purchase and own a silencer in 42 of our 50 U.S. states. (If you are hoping to buy one in California, Illinois, New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Delaware, Hawaii, or Washington D.C. you would be out of luck!) If you are in the 42 states that have legalized silencers, you can trust that Silencer Central is there with you. We are licensed in all of those 42 states.

  - Description & specs When Silencer Central partnered with Federal Premium Ammunition to develop a suppressor for the law enforcement market, the result was the award-winning BANISH Speed K. We took that design and made it lighter for hunting, home and livestock defense, and the competition shooter. The result is the new BANISH Speed K Ti that gives you a 20.6 decibel reduction. The Speed K Ti is made from durable and lightweight titanium and is perfect for AR-platform rifles. It has a 2-inch diameter and is just 4-inches long, and it only weighs 8.6 ounces. The BANISH Speed K Ti is a .223/5.56-caliber suppressor with clipped-wall baffles and a finned blast chamber. Using controlled flow technology and a vented 4th baffle, the Speed K Ti minimizes gas blowback that allows for only a 5.8% increase in blowback from unsuppressed shooting, enabling rifles to function smoothly without additional modification.

  - Description & specs The BANISH 45 is a modular silencer specifically designed for handguns and pistol caliber carbines in calibers ranging from .45 ACP down to rimfire. Testing shows the BANISH 45 suppresses a 9mm pistol by 36 decibels – far more sound reduction than the competition. Made with Titanium for the ultimate combination of durability and weight reduction, the BANISH 45 is the lightest in its class at a mere 9.6oz in the short configuration of 6.7”. You can also run it in the long configuration of 8.6” and still barely notice it’s on your gun because it weighs only 11 oz. Because of the BANISH 45’s modular design, you can run it with eight or 12 baffles, depending on your specific needs. Ideal for 3-gun or target shooting, the BANISH 45 will help protect the hearing of the shooter and others in a shooting competition and reduce recoil for quicker second shot target acquisition. User-serviceable from both ends, this suppressor can be easily and quickly disassembled for configuration changes and cleaning. You can easily clean the baffles by hand with a brush and your favorite solvent. Reassembly is just as easy, thanks to the keyed and indexed baffles. This guarantees that each one will be lined up perfectly for optimum performance. The unique design of the BANISH 45 makes it the one suppressor to fit any pistol caliber gun. Simply swap out the pistons (sold separately) and you can attach this suppressor to any multitude of pistols or pistol caliber carbines in your collection. Silencers are a significant investment, so it’s a huge plus to be able to use one can on multiple different firearms.

  - Features Features Tested #1 in sound reduction! In testing, BANISH proved to be the most effective suppressor in reducing the report of a firearm, reducing the sound of a .308 by more than 34 db! Suppresses recoil as well as sound The internal baffles handle the gas in such a way that the suppressor significantly reduces recoil as well as sound. Multi-caliber design All BANISH suppressors accommodate calibers that are smaller in diameter than marked. Made in USA 100% made and assembled in the United States. Can-clean™ technology Suppressors get dirty, that is just a fact of suppressor use. However, suppressors that cannot be easily cleaned quickly build up lead and powder residue, which increases their weight and decreases their performance. This isn’t a problem with BANISH CanClean technology. No special tools are required to take your BANISH Suppressor apart, making this one of the fastest cleaning suppressors on the market today. Stifle™ baffles A truly universal baffle stack, these baffles are used in all BANISH suppressors and can be reassembled in any order. This user-friendly design allows for the shooter to quickly clean and put their BANISH Suppressor back together, or reconfigure the suppressor length with minimal effort.

  - Description & specs The BANISH 22 suppressor is designed for use with rimfire pistols and rifles chambered in .22 caliber and smaller. This includes .22 Hornet, .17HMR, and even 5.7×28. It’s even rated for full-auto! Using 1/2×28 threads for direct attachment, the BANISH 22 is made of lightweight titanium, weighs just 4.1oz, is 1” in diameter, and only 5 ⅜” long. This means you’ll barely even notice that the BANISH 22 is on the end of your gun – except when it comes to sound reduction. Tests have shown that the BANISH 22 brings the sound down to about 120 decibels, making it barely louder than a BB-gun. Essentially, this is as close to “Hollywood quiet” as you can get. The Banish 22 at the muzzle tested at 116.8 dB on a 22LR with a 16″ barrel and 117.6 dB at the muzzle on a Ruger Mark IV. Since rimfire ammo uses projectiles that are not jacketed, lead buildup and carbon fouling are a real concern in a rimfire silencer. Over time without cleaning, it’s possible for a .22 suppressor to completely fill with lead and carbon, rendering it ineffective for sound suppression and adding considerable weight. The BANISH 22 was designed specifically to maximize your time shooting and minimize your time cleaning. Inside the tube are eight baffles that are engineered for a precise fit to keep lead debris and carbon buildup at an absolute minimum. This prevents the debris and buildup from reaching the tube, which causes components to fuse together. Once disassembled, cleaning couldn’t be simpler: toss the baffles in a tumbler, ultrasonic cleaner, or use good, old-fashioned elbow grease. With indexing lines on each baffle for easy realignment and reassembly, the BANISH 22 is the only rimfire silencer on the market that is user-serviceable from both ends. If you’re looking for the perfect first-time silencer purchase, the BANISH 22 is a great option. It’s ideal for varmint shooting, small game hunting, target practice, and more.

  - Description & specs The two most important factors for picking a suppressor for a backcountry hunt are sound suppression and weight, and the .30 caliber Banish Backcountry suppressor was built with those factors in mind. The entire Banish lineup prides itself on being quiet and lightweight, but the Backcountry recently reviewed on AllOutdoor.com takes things to a different level. You get the same unmatched sound suppression and durable titanium construction as the flagship Banish 30 suppressor, but in a package that’s shorter and lighter than ever before. The Backcountry is a fixed-length suppressor that measures 5.5” in length (5.7 with mount) and weighs just 7.8 ounces. That’s a full 1.3” shorter and 2.2 ounces lighter than the Banish 30 in its short configuration. That may not sound like much, but it makes a world of difference for backcountry adventurers who carefully pack their gear with size and weight in mind. Rated for calibers up to the .300 Remington Ultra Magnum (RUM), the Banish Backcountry utilizes six baffles that drop the decibel level down to 135 dB for .308 Winchester, 137 dB for .300 Win Mag, and 138 dB for .300 RUM at the ear – all of which fall below the hearing-safe threshold. Utilizing a 1.375×24 Universal Mount, the Banish Backcountry is a direct-thread suppressor designed to eliminate any extra weight associated with a muzzle device method of attachment, but it is also available with an optional muzzle brake attachment. When size, weight, and sound suppression are of the utmost concern, the Banish Backcountry suppressor allows you to pack in ounces, shoot at hearing-safe levels, and pack out pounds. All silencers require the purchase of a $200 Federal Tax Stamp.

  - Description & specs The newest addition to the BANISH line of suppressors is the BUCK 30, a high-performance hunting suppressor in partnership with Buck Commander. Buck Commander is all about the thrill of the hunt and the relationships that come with it. Silencer Central is all about making your silencer purchase process as simple and hassle-free as possible so that you can spend more time thinking about your next hunt. The BUCK 30 is a multi-caliber suppressor that works with all rifle calibers up to .300 Winchester Magnum. That makes it the perfect choice for all of your hunting adventures no matter how big or small. Made of stainless steel and laser welded for precision and durability, the BUCK 30 features the Buck Commander logo proudly displayed on its tubeless construction. At just 6.9” in length and 1.54” in diameter, it weighs only 13.8 oz. Equipped with an accuracy baffle, the BUCK 30 minimizes point of impact shift so you may only need to make slight sight adjustments when you switch between suppressed and unsuppressed shooting. Additionally, the BUCK 30 features an industry-standard hub mount giving users more options to connect their BUCK 30 to their host firearm. Despite the compact size, it packs an impressive amount of sound suppression. Tests show that a .308 from an 18” barrel registers 131 decibels at the ear. Similarly, 6.5 Creedmoor from a 20” barrel registers 132 decibels at the ear. Both are well under the hearing-safe limit of 140 decibels. If you want to reduce your recoil, save your hearing, improve your accuracy, and protect your hunt, then you need the BUCK 30 on your rifle the next time you adventure beyond the pavement. All silencers require the purchase of a $200 Federal Tax Stamp.

  - FAQs What’s the Silencer Buying Process Like? Buying a silencer can be an intimidating task. Dealing with the government and their seemingly constantly changing laws is enough to discourage even the most savvy shooting enthusiast. Silencer Central makes it simple to own a silencer. We do all the work for you and make it as easy as 1-2-3. Select your silencer – We offer the best brands and can help you choose the silencer that’s right for you. We do the paperwork – We will manage the entire buying process for you, let you pay for your silencer in installments and even set up a free NFA Gun Trust that allows others to use your silencer. Direct-to-your-door shipping – Once approved, we will ship you new silencer directly to your door. Are .308 suppressors illegal? No! .308 suppressors are legal in 42 states. Suppressors are only illegal in California, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, and Washington D.C. If you want to know more about the specific regulations on silencers in your state, read our state-by-state guide on silencer ownership. Silencers actually make guns safer by reducing the risk of hearing loss and making it possible to operate guns without earplugs. In this way, gun owners can be more aware and responsive to their surroundings. Suppressors are regulated, though, and that process can be a little daunting, even to the most seasoned gun-enthusiast. After all, most of us would rather be out on the range or hunting in the woods than sitting in front of a mountain of paperwork. Silencer Central is here to help navigate the paperwork, gun trust setup , wait time , and the entire buying process from start to finish. What makes Silencer Central different from other companies that sell Silencers online? Ten reasons to buy your silencer from Silencer Central! Select your silencer – We were the first silencer reseller and have been making silencer buying super simple since 2005!. Silencers are all we do – We are not a gun shop that sells silencers on the side like virtually everyone else. Talk to an expert – We have a full-time staff dedicated to making sure your silencer buying experience goes without a hitch. And, if there is ever an issue, you’ll always be able to talk directly to a silencer buying expert. Direct-to-your-door shipping – We have satellite locations in all 42 states where silencers are legal which allow us to deliver your new silencer directly to your door. States include: AL , AK , AZ , AR , CO , CT , FL , GA , IA , ID , KS , KY , LA , MD , ME , MI , MN , MO , MS , MT , ND , NE , NH , NM , NV , NC , OH , OK , OR , PA , SC , SD , TN , TX , UT , VA , VT , WA , WI , WV , & WY . Free NFA Gun Trust – We offer a free NFA Gun Trust (a $250 value) to all customers which essentially establishes a joint ownership scenario in which you can legally share your silencer with designated others (as well as determining who will inherit your silencer). This lets others use your silencer. Pay just 25% down – Our eZ-Pay Interest-Free Layaway Plan allows you to “pay for it while you wait for it”. Submitting your down payment of 25% allows us to file your transfer paperwork with the ATF while you pay off your balance over three months. And we do not charge you any interest! Barrel threading – In the event you need you rifle barrel threaded to accept your new silencer, we will take care of that as well through our Threading Central . We know the game – We are the only silencer reseller on the ATF advisory board which means we not only know the rules and the ropes but we influence them as well. Security – We know you are entrusting us with sensitive information and we are set up to protect it better than any gun shop. We also keep your trust and fingerprint records on file which allows you to streamline the process if you ever choose to buy another silencer. Shopping protection – Finally, buy from Silencer Central and you automatically get the Norton Shopping Guarantee which gives you identity theft protection, dispute resolution, and a lowest price guarantee. All for free. Can you put a suppressor on a non-threaded barrel? Yes, you can put a suppressor on a non-threaded barrel, although it can be a little tricky. Most suppressors are made for a threaded barrel, so you’ll need to find a different way to attach it. There are threading adapters on the market, but the best way to attach a silencer to a non-threaded barrel is to get your barrel threaded. Here at Silencer Central, we have our own threading service, where you can send us your barrel and get it threaded starting at $99.99. Can a .308 suppressor be used on .223? Technically it can, but it’s a little more complicated than that. If the suppressor can handle the shot’s pressure and the bullet can fit through the silencer’s bore, it can work. In most cases, a .308 silencer can then be used on a 223, since that is the case. However, you won’t get the same quality or performance as you would when using a multi-caliber silencer, like the BANISH 30 , or a suppressor designed for a 223. In other words, a .308 suppressor won’t silence a .223 as much as a .223 suppressor would.

  - Description & specs The Salvo™ 12 is the first commercially-viable shotgun suppressor and represents an incredible advance in engineering and technology. The Salvo 12 is designed to operate with nearly all shotguns and ammunition on the market today including pump actions, semi autos, and inertia driven models. Due to the modularity of the Salvo 12, the shooter can remove sections to balance their sound suppression, weight, and length needs and can attach the Salvo to their favorite shotgun with choke mounts available in improved cylinder, modified, improved modified, and full. This adaptability makes the Salvo 12 ideal for use with sporting clays, waterfowl, turkey hunting, home defense, and everything in between. At its full length of 12 inches, sound is brought down to 136.8 dB at the muzzle — well below the 140 dB hearing-safe threshold set by OSHA. Pair this sound reduction with a noticeable decrease in felt recoil, and after just a few rounds through the Salvo 12, you’ll never go back to shooting unsuppressed again. Attaches via choke mount to most commercially available gas operated, inertia driven, or pump action shotguns with barrels threaded for chokes. Modular design allow the user to shorten the silencer to 6″, 8″, or 10″ configurations to balance size, weight, and sound requirements. Rate for wadded shells up to 3″ including buckshot and slugs. Can be shortened to 8″ configuration and remain hearing safe at the ear. Noticeably reduces felt recoil.

This perfectly-engineered marvel includes a key element no other suppressor has ever incorporated: its own auxiliary two-port muzzle brake which reduces the recoil of suppressed fire.

The Barrett QDL Suppressor’s dual layered tube is constructed of heat treated high strength alloys. This, combined with redundant 360 degree welding, makes it the safest large bore suppressor on the market. By simply sliding the Suppressor over the muzzle brake directly into the indexing point, proper alignment is guaranteed every time. Once in place, the Barrett unique lock-ring coupler clicks into ratchet grooves for a secure fit that nothing can shake.

The Sierra is used extensively by law enforcement, military and other serious shooter communities. Our Sierra suppressor has been an outstanding rock star in the shooting world. We have received numerous reports from many sources stating that our .338 Lapua Sierra suppressor is much quieter than other manufacturers’ .308 suppressors. Thread: Most common is 5/8″ X 24 tpi, but many other thread patterns available. Using the described procedure for measuring sound, the actual sound pressure level reductions and specifications of our sound suppressor models are presented below. All Arabic numeral “1” sound suppressors are specifically designed for law enforcement and military tactical applications. Users frequently complain about a change of the point of impact between a rifle with and without a sound suppressor installed. This is most often a function of the inherent stiffness of the rifle’s barrel, not the sound suppressor. We offer the service or will instruct the customer in how to time out the suppressor to the weapon. This procedure will minimize the change of windage point of impact.

  - Description & specs The Elite Iron Alpha is 14” long, 2” in diameter, and weighs 4 lbs 2 oz. Thread pitches-  M25x1.5, 1 x 14 or 7/8 x 14. Made for bolt action, non-semi automatic 50 BMG rifles. This suppressor is not suitable for the Barrett semi-auto M82A1, M107, or M107A1. The AR50 uses the factory brake collar to attach and time this suppressor. For light weight .50cal rifles (such as the Barrett 99), user will feel a slight increase in felt recoil. .50cal suppressor can be used on the EDM ARMS M96 408cal. For .50 caliber bolt action rifles and depending upon an individual shooter’s experience, perceived recoil for suppressors is slightly more than with a muzzle brake. The actual visual of the flash signature from a suppressor at 50 yards and forward of the muzzle at a 45° angle is approximately the same as the striking of a BIC lighter. Thread: 1×14 or 7/8×14 Both the shooter and observer will be please with the sound reduction when the Alpha suppressor is in use. However, the sound you will be hearing is still above the safe hearing threshold. It is highly recommended that some type of hearing protection is used when firing the weapon. Users frequently complain about a change of the point of impact between a rifle with and without a sound suppressor installed. This is most often a function of the inherent stiffness of the rifle’s barrel, not the sound suppressor. We offer the service or will instruct the customer in how to time out the suppressor to the weapon. This procedure will minimize the change of windage point of impact. Note: This suppressor is NOT suitable for the Barrett semi-auto M82A1, M107, or M107A1.

  - Description & specs COASTAL GUN MODEL X 458/450 The X project was our challenge to come up with a new suppressor not just in design but also in the way our industry builds suppressors.  The idea was to get away from the norm.  X project silencers were not built using the typical tubing and machined endcaps. We started with aircraft grade billet.  Taking a solid piece of metal and machining a silencer.  No entrance cap, it is an integral part of the suppressor.  No spacers, they are machined into the suppressor body. Changing the outward appearance by adding spiral flutes to aid in cooling and to make this suppressor look like one “bad dude”.  Stainless steel thread inserts. There were, however, a few things we wanted to keep.  We use our tried and true V-Tech baffle and like all Coastal Gun Suppressors built over the past 20 years these units are never sealed.  There are two X project suppressors and both are built for multiple caliber use. Built for 458 Socom and 450 Bushmaster but can also be used for 45 ACP and 44 magnum carbine type rifles. The 458 Socom version is threaded for 5/8 x 32.

With caliber compatibility ranging from .22LR to 9mm and even 5.7x28mm, there’s very little you can’t do with this pistol suppressor. Due to its compact size – ranging from a tiny 2.75” to just 7.75” and 7.4 ounces in its full length – you’ll barely even notice the Odessa 9 on the end of your barrel. As an added bonus, the 1.1” diameter means that you won’t need suppressor height sights when used on most pistols. This is a big plus since most people don’t run suppressed all the time. The Odessa 9 ships with a 1/2×28 piston mount, but you can also use a variety of other common thread pistons and a fixed barrel spacer.

  - Description & specs Stand out from the crowd on the shooting line with the SilencerCo Velos LBP’s balance of exceptional sound performance without adding back pressure to the operating system of the host firearm. One of the main drawbacks to shooting a semi-auto rifle with a suppressor is the gas blowback that can hit the shooter in the face. Instead of relying on special charging handles or other products to mitigate the issue, the SilencerCo Velos LBP (Low Back-Pressure) was designed for optimal performance from a 5.56mm suppressor. Incorporating state-of-the-art manufacturing processes, such as a 3D-printed Inconel, the core of the Velos LBP is fully welded to the 17-4 front and rear modules. Coming in at just 5.98” long and weighing 15.2 ounces, there’s nothing else like it on the market today. Equipped with a Hoplon blast baffle, no barrel length restrictions, and a full-auto rating, the Velos LBP is the most durable suppressor SilencerCo has ever made. Pair it with existing SilencerCo Charlie accessories and you’re ready to shoot with less back pressure. All silencers require the purchase of a $200 Federal Tax Stamp.

This ingenious and compact design is masterfully constructed with robust materials to make it powerful enough to mute even Magnum caliber rounds without difficulty. Our 5-Axis CNC machines craft the QUELL with immense precision, resulting in a minimal POI shift and an extremely low risk of baffle strikes. This robust 6.9” long and 1.5″ diameter suppressor is made from 100% hardened 17-4 PH Stainless Steel which makes it able to withstand any environmental conditions you may find yourself in at 19 ounces when paired with its mount. The QUELL fixed baffle stack boasts impressive sound signature reduction, along with the high heat tolerance required for contemporary service carbines and precision rifle platforms that fire a large number of rounds. This durable construction allows it to be used in full-auto rifles, supersonic rifles with pistol barrels, as well as magnum caliber bolt guns – making it an ideal choice for any hard-use suppressor solution.

  - Description & specs Our patented zero baffle design breaks the mold of traditional 9mm suppressors. Introducing the first of its kind, Vanquish integrally suppressed rifle. No need to spend top dollar on ammo as the Vanquish was created to shoot even the cheapest ammunition and still sound incredible. Thanks to a ported barrel design, the sonic crack of 115-grain ammo is eliminated, resulting in a shot that sounds just as good as heavy-grain subs. Already shooting subsonic ammunition? We’ve made the ported barrel adjustable, allowing you to close the ports and preserve the velocity of the ammunition. The Vanquish requires virtually zero maintenance. Simply wipe down the outside of the barrel and run a cleaning patch down the inside of the barrel. That’s it. The Vanquish comes in two lengths, a full-size 16” rifle configuration, and a 10.5” short barrel version, and is compatible with any Mil-Spec upper receiver and AR-15 handguard that has an inside diameter of 1.6” or larger.

Title: How much faster will the Electronic Form 4 be?
Text: When it comes to the government – and especially the ATF – one can never know for sure. Presently, we don’t know how much faster it will be. With that said, our research based on previous electronic Form 4 approvals and the current electronic Form 1 approvals suggests that once this process gets rolling, the total time needed to secure a transfer approval of a silencer should be reduced from the current 10 months (or more) wait time, to an approximate 150 days.

Title: How will the eForms process change for me, the customer?
Text: The biggest change for the customer will be to acquire your username and PIN from the ATF.  To create an eForms account, visiteforms.atf.govto start the process. You will then receive your username from the ATF (they pick it, you do not) and choose a password and PIN (you pick it, they do not).You will still provide us all of your personal information, your fingerprints and your photo. The biggest change is on Silencer Central’s side as we will now submit all of your information electronically through the eForms website AND your wait time will significantly decrease.

Title: How will the Electronic Form 4 speed up the process?
Text: The ATF’s new electronic version of theForm 4will greatly expedite the time required to make these transfers. When a transfer applicant or dealer enters the data electronically, the data will now be transmitted digitally. This cuts out the repetitive need for data entry and validation.Electronic Form 4 submissions should arrive at the ATF instantaneously, ready for the approval process. All of the time needed for data entry will be cut from the processing time.

Title: If I file as an individual, can I add a trust at a later date?
Text: Yes, you can add any silencer to a trust after you buy it by filing as an individual. Just keep in mind a few things. You will need to have legal help is setting up the new trust and adding in the silencer. There will likely be fees involved, but we can’t predict what those will be. There is also the issue of a tax stamp. If you transfer your silencer to a trust, you will need to buy a new tax stamp for it under the trust, according to the ATF.

Title: If I file as an individual, will I really get my silencer faster?
Text: The short answer is yes, you likely will – for now. Approval times for trusts are speeding up, and batch approvals are happening, too. We have been working with the ATF to help make the process for trusts faster, but individual approvals are currently faster.

Title: Is Silencer Central ready for eForms?
Text: Yes, all of our processes are ready and in-place. Not only have we been very involved with the ATF in beta testing for this NEW ATF eForm 4 process, but Silencer Central was also one of the primary companies invited to the final testing and feedback session for eForms.

Title: What does this mean for my current order?
Text: 1. If you have already started your application through the paper-process, then you will need to stay on that path. It is not recommended to withdraw paper applications. Remember: you’re already in line, so why jump out and go to the back of a different one?2. ATF has stated that any withdrawals of pending paper applications will result in a one-year delay.

Title: What if I get approved before my eZ-Pay Plan is complete?
Text: Our interest free eZ-Pay plan is extremely popular at Silencer Central. We will continue to allow you to “pay for it while you wait for it.”  If you are approved before your payment plan is complete, simply pay off your balance and have your silencer shipped directly to your door.

Title: What if my paperwork has already been submitted to the ATF?
Text: If you have already started your application through the paper-process, then you will need to stay on that path. It is not recommended to withdraw paper applications.

Title: What if you don’t want to file electronically?
Text: The paper version will still be an option. If for any reason you decide you would rather submit on paper, you certainly can, and Silencer Central can still do that on your behalf as we have been doing for years. The wait time will remain similar to what it is currently.

Title: What is ATF Form 4 eForm?
Text: ATF electronic Form 4’s will change the Form 4 from a paper process to an entirely digital process. Silencer Central will submit everything to the ATF digitally and the ATF will send their approval digitally. This will speed up the process of buying and waiting for approval.

Title: What is the new pin number process and how do I set it up?
Text: The most important change that the ATF has made is the usage and creation of a PIN that will help submit your form digitally. This process will be similar to the pins that have been used for years with ATF Forms 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.To create an eForms account, visiteforms.atf.govto start the process. You will then receive your username from the ATF (they pick it, you do not) and choose a password and PIN (you pick it, they do not).

Title: What makes paper-based Form 4 transfers so slow?
Text: There are two logical answers to this question. The first is the time it takes for paperwork to make it through the mail, and with postal reliability these days, there’s no telling when your paperwork may actually arrive. Thankfully, that’s now a thing of the past!The second reason is the amount of time devoted to data entry. When a silencer dealer or individual sends completed paperwork to the ATF to secure permission for a Form 4 transfer, employees at the ATF have to manually enter the data from the forms. (Yes, that’s right: the ATF takes your paper form and enters it into a computer instead of just having you enter it electronically in the first place.)As you can imagine, this is a time-consuming process. The data must be entered, and then checked, and this process is typically taking upwards of 9 months as of the time of writing.

Title: Which is better - Trust or Individual?
Text: The real answer to this is that it is entirely up to you. Only you can decide what works best for your circumstances. It’s pretty obvious that we tend to prefer trusts for the flexibility they provide. That’s why we offer trust setup as a free service. However, we also see the benefit to individual filing, as you will likely get your silencer faster.  Go through all the pros and cons to each and just know that we’re here to help you regardless of what you choose.

Title: Will ATF eForms reduce wait times?
Text: Yes, we anticipate a significant decrease in wait times once the ATF eForm 4 is launched.

Title: Will filing as a trust ever be as fast as filing as an individual?
Text: That is the goal that we and the ATF are working toward. We are always looking at how we can optimize our process, and we work with the ATF to see what can be done better. The ATF has told us that they are adding more staff and are working toward having the approval process be as close to equal as possible. But it isn’t there yet. We will keep everyone informed.

Title: With eForms, will Silencer Central still be able to ship directly to my door?
Text: The eForms process only enhances Silencer Central’s process. We will still have the ability to mail your silencer directly to you. The variances we have with the ATF have allowed us to run most of our processes digitally so the only piece that is changing is we will now submit your application electronically to the ATF.

Title: Why Are Silencers (Suppressors) in Such High Demand?
Text: Until recently, most Americans thought silencers were illegal. There are many benefits: better hunting, no hearing protection, reduced recoil, better accuracy, and happy neighbors. This market segment is the fastest growing in the firearms industry; we have been in this market exclusively since 2005.

Title: What Are the Benefits of Owning a Silencer?
Text: There are countless benefits of owning a silencer, a few of which include:Better Experience– Game is less likely to spook while hunting.Reduces Recoil– Significantly reduces recoil when you shoot.Increased Accuracy– Because of recoil reduction.Less Noise– Means you won’t disrupt neighbors, family or pets.Great for Family– Added safety for even the youngest family members.

Title: How Do You Choose Which Silencers to Keep in Stock?
Text: Through our over 12 years of experience in the silencer marketplace, we’ve found customers have three main issues driving their purchasing decisions:Best sound reductionBest value for the price; andLightest weight for shooting convenienceDue to customer demand for these three types of silencers, we carry a large volume in each category. Of course, we’re also here to provide any other silencer you may want. As such, we can order any manufacturer’s silencer to ensure you have everything you need.When you’re browsing your options, please note that a higher price doesn’t automatically mean that a silencer will be quieter. Large manufacturers commonly compromise value to mass produce in large volumes and turn larger profits (meaning you’ll pay more for less quality). As always, you can contact our staff between 8:30 a.m. and 5 p.m. during the week and after hours via email to assist with the purchasing process if you aren’t sure which silencer is right for you. Please tap into our experience and expertise.

Title: How Do You Test Your Silencers?
Text: At Silencer Central, we sell only the best, so we test with only the best.

We don’t carry any silencers that don’t meet our strict criteria and as such, you can purchase any of our products with confidence.

Title: Are Silencers as Quiet as on the Movies?
Text: The only silencer as quiet in real life as it appears in movies is the.22 rimfire. All other calibers will sound like a .22 short to a .22 long when suppressed. However, every silencer we sell is hearing safe, meaning you won’t need additional hearing protection. See thesilencer sound chartby caliber.

Title: Am I "grandfathered" in after I purchase my first suppressor?
Text: No, when you purchase your next suppressor you will still need to complete the ATF application process, pay the $200 tax stamp, and wait for approval. However, Silencer Central keeps your fingerprints and passport-style photo on file in a secured location making the preparation of your application on future purchases fast and simple.

Title: If I file as an individual, can I add a trust at a later date?
Text: Yes, you can add any silencer to a trust after you buy it by filing as an individual. Just keep in mind a few things. You will need to have legal help is setting up the new trust and adding in the silencer. There will likely be fees involved, but we can’t predict what those will be. There is also the issue of a tax stamp. If you transfer your silencer to a trust, you will need to buy a new tax stamp for it under the trust, according to the ATF.

Title: Can I Use a .30 Caliber Silencer on All Sub Calibers?
Text: Yes! Doing so is very common with a stacked baffle design, like theBANISH 30.Having one silencer for all rifle applications doesn’t often impact performance because.308 silencersare longer with additional baffles. Due to its light weight, titanium is one of the most popular materials for application on all sub calibers. Please note that not all.308 silencerswork well on a .223. Stack baffle design is typically best for dual application because there is a greater surface area to remove heat from the blast.In recent tests, we found that our own exclusive silencer, theBANISH 30, was quieter on a .223 than a.223 silencerwas. Additionally, we have tested some silencers that are not hearing safe on all sub-calibers. As such, it’s best to ask our staff if you have a specific question about certain models.

Text: No, rifle silencers are actually legal in 42 U.S. states. Only 9 states (California, Illinois, New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Delaware, Hawaii and Washington D.C). ban individual ownership of silencers or suppressors.Lucky for you, Silencer Central is here to make the process easy!

Title: Can you put a silencer on a rifle?
Text: Absolutely. In fact, rifles are by far the most common type of firearm on which to mount a silencer. Like rifles, silencers are common among hunters. Your hunting rifle should definitely have a silencer, because first and foremost, they reduce noise pollution. Meaning you’re not going to scare off every critter in a 10 mile radius.But silencers also reduce recoil, muzzle blast, and the risk of hearing damage. They also are known to increase accuracy, helping you make that once-in-a-lifetime shot. Some rifles can also be integrally suppressed to reduce noise even more. They also have important safety benefits, like allowing you to be more aware of your surroundings. Without having to wear hearing protection, you can listen for sounds of other predators or hunters.

Title: What is the quietest rifle suppressor?
Text: Well the jury’s out on this one, because there is so much that affects asuppressor’s dB testingat any given time. A gunshot’s volume, measured in decibels, or “dB”, depends on the weight, caliber, and speed of the bullet, the length of the barrel, not to mention how fast the gunpowder is burning. A gunshot can also be impacted by something as simple as temperature or humidity.Price is not necessarily indicative of quality. But material is. The best suppressors are made out of 100% titanium. Titanium is both lightweight and quicker at cooling hot muzzle gas than steel or aluminum.If we had to choose a quietest silencer to recommend, we’d suggest theBANISH 30multi-caliber suppressor, because it has the highest sound reduction in comparison to its competitors of similar weight and material.

Title: What is the best rifle suppressor?
Text: What is the best rifle suppressor? This is up for debate, but we’re partial to the BANISH line of silencers. BANISH suppressors are the original multi-caliber suppressors, making them incredibly versatile and able to fit more than just one gun. OurBANISH suppressorswere designed to be most user friendly silencers on the market, without sacrificing quality.When buying a suppressor, you should make sure to think about what caliber you need, what material it’s made out of, how it will impact your performance (ie. point-of-impact shift, velocity, recoil), whether you need a threaded barrel, if you’re interested in subsonic shooting, getting the paperwork done with the ATF, and price.You should also consider how and why you’ll be using it. Are you hoping to reduce noise pollution? Increase the accuracy of your shots? Trying to reduce the risk of hearing loss? All these factors will contribute to the type of silencer that works best for you.

Title: How do rifle suppressors work?
Text: When you fire a round, burning gas builds up pressure behind the bullet and thrusts it down your bore. When the bullet leaves, a burst of host gas exists behind it, releasing a loud noise.In comes a silencer. A silencer slows down the gas by redirecting it through a series of baffles before it can escape the silencer. This allows any unburnt powder to finish burning off, which reduces muzzle flash. It also gives the gas more time to slow down and cool, so that when it does escape the silencer, it’s moving slower and under less pressure, which means it’s also quieter.If you want to learn more about how silencers work and get into the nitty gritty, check out our article,“An Inside Look at How Suppressors Work”.

Title: How do I choose the right rifle silencer?
Text: Choosing the right silencer can be complicated. There are a ton of different factors that come into play, including ones you may not have thought about. These include things like material, weight, length, caliber compatibility, price, and whether or not it’s threaded.You might also want to consider how you are using it. Is your silencer going on a rifle or a .22? Is it a hunting rifle, or one you keep for protection? What are your goals? To reduce the risk of hearing loss? Have less noise pollution? Increase your shot’s accuracy? Reduce recoil? All these factors make a difference.That’s why the Silencer Central team is here to help. Our sales staff will walk you through the process from start to finish, from choosing the right silencer, to filling out the paperwork, and getting it in your hands.

Title: Are pistol silencers legal?
Text: Yes, pistol silencers are legal. Silencers, while regulated, actually make guns safer for everyone. They reduce the risk of hearing loss, allowing gun owners to operate without earplugs, which in turn, helps them be much more aware of their surroundings.So yes. With the exception of 8 states (California, Illinois, New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Delaware, Hawaii), and one federal district, Washington D.C, owning suppressors is legal in the United States of America. If you want to know more about the specific regulations on silencers in your state, read ourstate-by-state guide on silencer ownership.And if the process seems a little daunting, don’t worry. Silencer Central is here to help you navigate the buying process, wait time, and paperwork. We’re licensed in all 42 states where pistol silencers are legal.

Title: Do pistol silencers work?
Text: Yes, absolutely. Silencers offer many of the same benefits to pistol shooters as they do to rifle and shotgun shooters. Even thebest Pistol silencerstend to get a bad rap because unlike rifles or shotguns, pistols are often bought to conceal or be discreet.However, a suppressed pistol is a great training aid. Suppressors reduce recoil and noise flinch. A silencer makes a gun safer and more manageable, with less risk of hearing loss, and allows you to take off your hearing protection and be aware of the space around you. A silencer also reduces noise pollution, recoil, and muzzle flash, and increases accuracy. In some cases, it might even increase the velocity of the bullet.

Title: How loud is a silenced pistol?
Text: How loud a suppressed pistol is depends greatly upon the caliber being fired and the suppressor being used. Unlike in the movies, a silencer won’t give you a completely soundless bullet whispering through the air. The word “suppressor” is really more accurate because these products suppress the sound of a gun rather than silence it.That said, the level of sound suppression you typically get from a silencer is between 20 – 36 dB. Which is enough to significantly reduce the risk of hearing damage. Essentially, suppressors make guns just quiet enough to reduce most or all of the downsides associated with extremely loud gunshots.See our article abouthow we test our silencersfor more information.

Title: Is 45 ACP quieter than 9mm?
Text: A .45 ACP and a 9mm blast will likely sound very similar. That said, a suppressed .45 ACP will likely be quieter than asuppressed 9mm.But this is actually a very complicated question to answer because it depends on more than ammunition. It will also depend on the gun, barrel length, silencer being used, and more uncontrollable factors like the weather and humidity.Technically, because standard .45 ACP ammo is subsonic, it is more effectively suppressed than 9mm ammo. 9mm is actually what can be called “supersonic”, which means that it breaks the sound barrier. Supersonic bullets are generally louder because a suppressor cannot quiet the sonic “crack,” so a suppressor will probably do more for a 45 ACP than a 9mm.That being said, it really will depend on more factors than just ammo, and the difference we’re talking about here is small. In general, it’s best to use hearing protection when shooting a gun. But both a silenced .45 ACP and silenced 9mm will be below 140 dB, the OSHA threshold for hearing damage.

Title: What is the quietest 9mm suppressor?
Text: In our opinion, the best pistol silencer is aBANISH 45, since its interchangeable piston mounting system makes it so versatile. Its lightweight titanium body and great sound reduction make it easily a great option for a 9mm.We also like the Illusion 9. Illusion 9’s unique design allows shooters to see easier and effectively use the standard iron sights on the pistol. The downside is, of course, that it is only available for a 9mm, so is less versatile.For a full breakdown, check out our 2020 round-up ofbest pistol silencers.

Title: What pistols can have silencers?
Text: Most standard pistols can be used with silencers, but we recommend talking with our team to know for sure if your pistol is ideal for being used with a silencer.

Text: No, shotgun silencers are absolutely not illegal. With the exception of a few homebrew, DIY contraptions, all silencers are legal in 42 of our great 50 states.

Title: Can you put a silencer on a 12 gauge shotgun?
Text: You sure can, with the one and only commercially available shotgun suppressor, the SilencerCo Salvo 12.

Title: Can you put a silencer on a shotgun?
Text: Until recently, the answer to this question was “no.” However, to the benefit of shotgun owners around America, that has finally changed.These days, you can absolutely silence a shotgun. The folks over at SilencerCo have made it possible with theSalvo 12.The Salvo 12 is a 6.73-12.52″ aluminum beauty that can handle nearly all shotguns and ammunition on the market today including pump actions, semi-autos, and inertia driven models. It puts the sound down to a safe 136.8 dB, well below the 140 dB recommended by OSHA.A shotgun silencer like the Salvo 12 is perfect for turkey hunting out near our headquarters in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, or if that’s not your speed, sporting waterfowl or clay pigeons, or yes, home defense.

Title: How many decibels does a silencer reduce on a shotgun?
Text: The Salvo 12 is the only shotgun silencer on the market, and at its full-length configuration, it brings a shotgun’s noise level down to 136.8 dB. Which, according to OSHA, is considered safe without additional hearing protection.

Title: Why are shotgun silencers so expensive?
Text: There is only one commercially available shotgun silencer on the market, the Salvo 12. There is an incredible amount of engineering and design that has gone into building the world’s first widely-available shotgun silencer. The quality of work inherent to this product is reflected in the price.Naturally, though, if and when more shotgun silencers eventually do make it onto the commercial market, we will likely see a wider range of prices. But until then, you have a great choice with the Salvo 12, and although the price isn’t flexible, you can at the very least trust that it is a one-of-a-kind piece of craftsmanship.

If you are in a state that allows silencer ownership, what’s the next step? It’s simple, really – If you can legally own a gun, you can also own a silencer. Ready to get started? Let’s go!

IN WHICH STATES ARE SUPPRESSORS LEGAL?

There are 42 out of 50 states where you can own a suppressor, which means that people living in 84% of the United States are able to own a suppressor. The odds are definitely in your favor, but we can’t forget about the unfortunate other 16% of the population. The eight prohibited states for suppressor ownership include California, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Massachusetts, New York, New Jersey, and Rhode Island. (They’re also illegal in the District of Columbia, which isn’t a state.) We continue to try and work for you in these states, and will keep you posted of any developments.

WHERE IS IT LEGAL TO HUNT WITH A SUPPRESSOR?

Hunting is legal in 41 of the 42 states where suppressors are legal. If you’re a hunter and a suppressor owner in Connecticut, I’ve got some bad news. You live in the only state where you can own a suppressor but not hunt with one.

Fortunately, the attitude toward the use of suppressors while hunting has been changing in a good way. Since 2011, 19 states have legalized hunting with a suppressor. Hopefully, the last state will follow suit.

HOW TO BUY A SUPPRESSOR: A STEP-BY-STEP PROCESS

Buying a silencer with the help of Silencer Central is easy! Let’s walk through each of the necessary steps first so that you’ll know what to do when it comes time to make your first suppressor purchase.

CALL OR BUY ONLINE

Whether you prefer to do the whole process online or talk to a person while you work your way through it, we’re here to help. You can fill out pretty much everything you’ll need to get started on your own online, but we know that you might have some questions. In that case, you can ask us online through the chat feature or just give us a call on the phone and we’ll be happy to go through it with you that way as well.

BUY A FEDERAL TAX STAMP

Thefederal tax stampfor a suppressor costs $200. The cost of the stamp is added to your invoice when you buy from us or any other dealer. The government controls the price of the tax stamp, so there’s no way to “shop around” for a deal on that. It is what it is.

SUBMIT OR EFILE THE NECESSARY PAPERWORK

Now that the ATF has gotten the eForm 4 back up and running, you caneFileall of your necessary paperwork. This is, hands down, the fastest and most convenient way to submit everything for approval. If, however, you prefer the old-school method of hard copy paperwork sent through the mail, you can still do it that way. Just know that the hard copy approval time is currently about four times as long as the eFile approval time.

PAY WHILE YOU WAIT WITH EZ-PAY

Silencer Central also makes buying a silencer easy with our eZ-Pay program. We let you start your ATF paperwork and pay your silencer off over three months while the paperwork processes. Just pay 25 percent down, and 25 percent a month for the next three months, and pay your silencer off while you wait for ATF approval. Buying a silencer has never been easier. You can even include the cost of your tax stamp in the eZ-Pay program or set up recurring monthly payments on your credit or debit card to make paying off your silencer easier.

HAVE YOUR rifle BARREL THREADED BY A FULL-TIME GUNSMITH

Don’t have a threaded barrel on the firearm you want to use your silencer on? We offer a uniquebarrel threading servicewhere you can ship the gun directly to us, or drop it off at any gun show we attend. Simply strip your rifle down to a barreled action for easy handling, and we’ll do the rest.



We want to make sure getting your barrel threaded is as easy and painless as possible, so we’ve put a lot of time and energy into making our barrel threading program the best in the country. Even if you didn’t buy a silencer from us, we are happy to thread your barrel because every gun owner deserves the best for their rifle.

GET YOUR SUPPRESSOR SHIPPED RIGHT TO YOUR DOOR

This is one of the best benefits of buying your new suppressor from Silencer Central. We have FFLs set up inall 42 stateswhere suppressors are legal to own and use. Once your approved form and stamp come back to us from the ATF, through our FFL in your state, we will ship your suppressor right to your front door.

That’s not a turn of phrase or some kind of marketing gimmick – it’s 100% true. We will ship your suppressor right to you!

NFA TRUST VS. INDIVIDUAL  filing – WHICH DO YOU CHOOSE?

Due to popular demand, we have added the option to submit your eForm 4 to the ATF as an individual or as a trust. You are given the opportunity to select from both during checkout. There are several pros and cons to each, but the main thing to keep in mind is this – Individual filing offers speed of approval, while the trust offers more flexibility for you. We understand that this can be a harder decision. Of course, we want you to be completely informed and comfortable, so we added a lot of informationlaying out both in a separate post.

All of the information that is needed to purchase your suppressor – your name, pertinent info, address, make, model, and serial number of the suppressor, etc. – is also needed to register your suppressor with an NFA gun trust. Since we have all of that information from you to facilitate the purchase, we can easily use that information to create your free NFA gun trust.

While we obviously prefer the trust option, so much so that we made it a free service we offer, you don’t have to use it. You can also file as an individual or even as a corporation. There arebenefits and drawbacksto each of the three options, so if you’re not sure, give us a call and we can figure out what is best for your specific situation. That said, 99.5% of our customers end up using our free gun trust. It is entirely up to you.

IS IT REALLY FREE?

Yes, it really is free! When you buy a silencer from Silencer Central, your trust is free. That’s our little way of saying thank you for your business.

This Gun Trust is 20-plus pages and allows you to add unlimited co-trustees to also use your silencers or other NFA items. We offer this Gun Trust FREE if you purchase a silencer from Silencer Central. We also help ensure you completed the gun trust correctly so ATF does not reject it. We have completed over 15,000 silencers to gun trust transfers and counting.

HOW DO GUN TRUSTS WORK?

Buying a suppressor in the name of a gun trust is very popular, and comes with a number of advantages. It gives you options for how you use your suppressor and peace of mind.

- Each person on the trust may possess the silencer. That means you can let your spouse, family member, or even a trusted friend use the silencer without added paperwork or needing to be in your presence. If you filed as an individual, youmustbe present when anyone else uses your silencer, which can be a pain.
- Just because a gun trust is a legal document doesn’t mean your decisions are final and locked in forever. You can change the trust anytime you need to – without letting the BATFE know. This lets you add or remove people at your leisure.
- Once you form a trust, you can use it again and again when buying other silencers or NFA items. Trusts make legacy planning easy. Just add the person you want to inherit the silencer to your trust.

How does filing as an individual work?

It does simplify things a little, due to less paperwork being involved. Like we said, you simply select individual during checkout and we take it from there. Because the ATF is super-fast on turnaround time for approvals right now, you will likely get your suppressor much faster with an individual application. If you have succession planning for firearms in your will, depending upon wording, a trust may be redundant. Unless you set it up with us as part of our free service during the purchase process, trusts can be expensive, too. If you didn’t want to spend to create a trust in addition to the costs of the tax stamp and the suppressor purchase price, an individual application may be very appealing.

The downfall to individual filing is losing the flexibility to say who can use your suppressor. You suppressor has to be in your possession, so loaning one to a buddy means you have to be with it all of the time.  If you want to addyour silencer(s) to a trust in the future, it will require a new Form 4 and an additional $200 tax stamp per silencer.

FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS ABOUT THE SUPPRESSOR BUYING PROCESS

Buying a suppressor isn’t hard, but that doesn’t mean that there aren’t some common questions that most first-time buyers have. In all the years we’ve been in this business, we’ve gotten pretty good at knowing what the most frequently asked questions are about the suppressor buying process.

HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE TO BUY A SUPPRESSOR?

Buying a suppressor doesn’t take long at all. It’s fairly simple to fill out all of the forms and paperwork,submit your fingerprintsand photo, etc. Getting approval for your suppressor from the ATF after you buy it, however, takes a little longer.

HOW DO I BUY A SUPPRESSOR TAX STAMP?

Buying a suppressor tax stamp is an easy and automatic part of the buying process since your approved forms from the ATF cannot be completed without buying the stamp. They cost $200 and are added to your invoice when you buy from us or any other dealer.

HOW DO I BUY A SUPPRESSOR ONLINE?

By now, you know that the whole “buy a gun online” thing the way it’s portrayed in the media is 100% false. Still, you can buy guns online. In that same vein, youcanbuy a suppressor online. You can even fill out all of the paperwork online, too. However, the purchase is still governed by the NFA branch of the ATF, so it’s not like you can just add it to your cart and have it sent to you by next-day delivery.

Buying from Silencer Central is the easiest way to buy a silencer, and it’s the closest you can get to “click-and-ship” online buying.

HOW DO ATF EFORMS IMPACT THE BUYING PROCESS?

ATF eForms make the suppressor buying process easier and faster. Everything can be done online and there’s no more snail mail involved. This means that approvals from the ATF will be much faster than the 15 months or so that it has taken in the past.

CAN I HUNT WITH MY SUPPRESSOR?

Hunting is legal in 41 of the 42 states where suppressors are legal, and there are a lot of reasons why you should hunt with one so long as it’s legal for you to do so. The one where you can own but not hunt with a suppressor is Connecticut.

CAN I USE ONE SILENCER FOR MULTIPLE FIREARMS?

The short answer is yes, you can use one silencer for multiple firearms. However, different suppressors are rated for different calibers, so be sure to read the description of the suppressor before you shoot the wrong caliber through your silencer. Not only can you damage the silencer and your gun, but you can also hurt yourself that way.

DO I NEED TO HAVE A CLASS 3 LICENSE IN ORDER TO PURCHASE A SUPPRESSOR?

Believe it or not, there really is no such thing as a “Class 3 License.” That term is derived from a Class 3 SOT, which is part of the licensing you need in order to sell a suppressor. So, no, you don’t need a Class 3 License to purchase a suppressor.

Silence Delivered ™ Making silencer buying simple since 2005. We are passionate about the compliancy, knowledge and community education in firearm sound suppression. We started Silencer Central over 15 years ago in order to offer customers a more simplified process for safely and legally obtaining a firearm sound suppressor (silencer). Today, we are solely dedicated to Class 3 firearms in the form of silencers. We recently sat down with the NRA publication America’s First Freedom to discuss why silencers are an increasingly important part of the firearms industry and how Silencer Central remains committed to working tirelessly on behalf of silencer owners everywhere. Our educated staff is continually updated on new government regulation for the successful purchase and registration of proper silencers for your needs. Because of you – our dedicated customers – Silencer Central has grown to become one of the largest Class 3 dealers. We make it our mission to obtain inventory quickly, expediting communication and approvals from the Administrative Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF). We aim to simplify your silencer purchasing experience.
