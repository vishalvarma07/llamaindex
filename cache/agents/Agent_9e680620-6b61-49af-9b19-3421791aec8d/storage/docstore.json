Recently reviewed in a featured editorial article in the NRA\u2019s American Rifleman magazine , it works with your rimfire and rifle calibers from .17 to .300 Weatherby and can be configured in two different lengths. All BANISH suppressors have been designed for unmatched sound suppression. (After all, the whole point is to reduce sound!) Internal testing shows that BANISH 30 reduces the report of a .308 by a whopping 34 decibels at a minimum. The BANISH 30 comes as a 9-inch suppressor holding eight baffles, but if you\u2019ll be shooting suppressed in tighter, confined spaces or hunting blinds, it can easily break down and assemble into a 7-inch configuration with six baffles. This suppressor also weighs considerably less than most suppressors of similar size. This is because the BANISH 30 \u2013 like all of the other BANISH suppressors in the lineup \u2013 is made from a strong titanium alloy for unmatched durability at an extremely light weight. In the full configuration, it weighs 14 ounces; in the short configuration, it weighs just 11 ounces. You\u2019ll be hard pressed to even feel it on your gun! Unlike comparable models from competitors, the BANISH 30 is completely user-serviceable. It easily comes apart for cleaning in a tumbler, ultrasonic cleaner, or manually. Reassembly is a breeze due to the baffles being keyed and indexed for alignment. Perfect for target practice, competitive shooting, or in the field while big game hunting, the BANISH 30 will reduce the sound signature and mitigate some of the recoil on your rifle. All silencers require the purchase of a $200 Federal Tax Stamp .

In testing, BANISH proved to be the most effective suppressor in reducing the report of a firearm, reducing the sound of a .308 by more than 34 db! Suppresses recoil as well as sound The internal baffles handle the gas in such a way that the suppressor significantly reduces recoil as well as sound. Multi-caliber design All BANISH suppressors accommodate calibers that are smaller in diameter than marked. Made in USA 100% made and assembled in the United States. Can-clean\u2122 technology Suppressors get dirty, that is just a fact of suppressor use.

(You should, however, look into a dedicated rimfire suppressor, like the BANISH 22. ) The AR15 has quickly become one of the most popular rifles on the market, and the BANISH 223 suppressor is optimized to run on that platform as well, not just traditional bolt-action hunting and target rifles. As an added perk, it\u2019s even rated for limited full-auto fire. With a sound reduction of 34 decibels, the reduced report provided by the BANISH 223\u2019s expansion tube and seven baffles will not only protect your hearing but also the hearing of anyone shooting around you, and it will help keep the sound from spooking other animals. The BANISH 223 is a direct-thread silencer that mounts on conventional 1/2\u00d728 threads. Made of lightweight titanium, this 7\u201d suppressor weighs a mere 11.4 ounces. While centerfire rounds are generally jacketed, buildup of the copper jackets in the baffles still occurs. Since there is more power (and powder) behind centerfire rounds, there is greater carbon buildup than from rimfire rounds.

Yes, BANISH suppressors are among the quietest and most high-quality suppressors on the market. Sure, we might be a little biased. But you can\u2019t blame us for being proud. BANISH suppressors were the first multi-caliber silencers out there on the market. You don\u2019t have to buy a suppressor for every gun in your safe. Rather, you can buy one (or maybe two, if it\u2019s a holiday) BANISH suppressor to fit all of them. A single BANISH 30 can work any rifle caliber from .22 to .308 by simply changing the front end-caps. We put 27 silencers to the test, and the BANISH 30 came was second only to the Yankee Hill Machine Resonator. The YMH Resonator is a quality silencer, but the advantage of the BANISH is that it can also come apart to clean. Can I Use a .30 Caliber Silencer on All Sub Calibers? Yes! Doing so is very common with a stacked baffle design, like the BANISH 30 . Having one silencer for all rifle applications doesn\u2019t often impact performance because .308 silencers are longer with additional baffles. Due to its light weight, titanium is one of the most popular materials for application on all sub calibers. Please note that not all .308 silencers work well on a .223. Stack baffle design is typically best for dual application because there is a greater surface area to remove heat from the blast. In recent tests, we found that our own exclusive silencer, the BANISH 30 , was quieter on a .223 than a .223 silencer was. Additionally, we have tested some silencers that are not hearing safe on all sub-calibers. As such, it\u2019s best to ask our staff if you have a specific question about certain models. Can I use one silencer for multiple firearms? Yes. Buy one silencer and you can use it on all guns of smaller caliber.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8801b526-bbb6-4646-9016-96a74fe8dc9e": {"__data__": {"id_": "8801b526-bbb6-4646-9016-96a74fe8dc9e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "scrape.txt", "file_name": "scrape.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 334689, "creation_date": "2024-07-10", "last_modified_date": "2024-07-02", "last_accessed_date": "2024-07-11"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "bd6b66b4-bb19-4515-b495-19f42d286bba", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "scrape.txt", "file_name": "scrape.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 334689, "creation_date": "2024-07-10", "last_modified_date": "2024-07-02", "last_accessed_date": "2024-07-11"}, "hash": "a7aaa12b0a6af5d4e7255e2fbb753b03068b049f0a6ab8d9a6ce618ad0c97590", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "c78230f7-af96-43fa-98df-e92936dd923a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "scrape.txt", "file_name": "scrape.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 334689, "creation_date": "2024-07-10", "last_modified_date": "2024-07-02", "last_accessed_date": "2024-07-11"}, "hash": "f3dda9c8392df898529a503b89a388aefd971a549853d1940d5a01b76f2e69dd", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "b0b3e78d-208b-4d7f-90e7-b38366f38860", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "scrape.txt", "file_name": "scrape.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 334689, "creation_date": "2024-07-10", "last_modified_date": "2024-07-02", "last_accessed_date": "2024-07-11"}, "hash": "1ed1f52f37e02242b3340dfd1c8449929ebfe278a9a8fb5265ff2984d9001da5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "1b070bb70d0c1cb335d6d3cf7e319b9e01e627ab118628cb5606da0dafb92527", "text": "Having one silencer for all rifle applications doesn\u2019t often impact performance because .308 silencers are longer with additional baffles.

Can I use one silencer for multiple firearms? Yes. Buy one silencer and you can use it on all guns of smaller caliber. For example, if you bought the Banish 30 Multi-Caliber Suppressor , it will work with all of your rifle calibers from .17 to .30 caliber magnums How long does it take to get a tax stamp for a BANISH suppressor? As a ballpark estimate, it could take anywhere from 30 days (if you e-file an ATF Form 1), to 12 months (if you e-file an ATF Form 3 ). But how long it actually takes to get a tax stamp will depend on a few key factors. First, which form are you using to register your silencer? If you are buying your suppressor from an FFL dealer or someone selling their own suppressor, you can register it with an ATF Form 4. If you are registering a homemade silencer, you need to use an ATF Form 1. Second, it will depend on if you file your form digitally, as an e-file, or send in a paper form in the mail. Like most things these days, you can anticipate an e-file being processed faster than the paper copy. Third, it will depend on if you have registered your silencer as an individual or as an NFA gun trust. Check out our full guide to getting a suppressor tax stamp for more information.

With clipped-wall baffles and a finned blast chamber, the Speed K ensures maximum sound reduction while maintaining optimal performance. Featuring controlled flow technology and a vented 4th baffle, this duty suppressor minimizes gas blowback for a better shooting experience. The design allows for only a 5.8% increase in blowback from unsuppressed shooting, enabling rifles to function smoothly without additional modification. Designed in partnership with Federal Ammunition and law enforcement professionals, the Speed K was built for those in uniform who demand excellence from their equipment. The silencer is constructed with 100% Inconel for durability and lower heat retention. Passing seven rounds of SOCOM testing, the Speed K is extremely durable and won\u2019t fail when it matters most. One round of SOCOM testing puts 1,440 rounds through the suppressor in a short period. Many suppressors don\u2019t pass one round of SOCOM testing, let alone seven rounds! At 4 inches in length, the Speed K is the perfect choice when maneuverability and speed are vital to a successful mission.

All for free. Does a silencer count as barrel length? No, a silencer does not count as barrel length. A silencer will only count towards barrel length if it has been permanently pinned and welded on. There is not a good reason to attach a silencer permanently, since it reduces its usability and makes it harder to clean. The only real reason to do so is to lengthen your gun\u2019s barrel in order to avoid buying a SBR tax stamp. But usually, the cost to safely affix a silencer permanently is more than the cost of the stamp. Can you put a silencer on a rifle? Absolutely. In fact, rifles are by far the most common type of firearm on which to mount a silencer. Like rifles, silencers are common among hunters. Your hunting rifle should definitely have a silencer, because first and foremost, they reduce noise pollution. Meaning you\u2019re not going to scare off every critter in a 10 mile radius. But silencers also reduce recoil, muzzle blast, and the risk of hearing damage. They also are known to increase accuracy, helping you make that once-in-a-lifetime shot. Some rifles can also be integrally suppressed to reduce noise even more. They also have important safety benefits, like allowing you to be more aware of your surroundings. Without having to wear hearing protection, you can listen for sounds of other predators or hunters. Are .223/5.56 silencers illegal? No, .223/5.56 silencers are not illegal.

We took that design and made it lighter for hunting, home and livestock defense, and the competition shooter. The result is the new BANISH Speed K Ti that gives you a 20.6 decibel reduction. The Speed K Ti is made from durable and lightweight titanium and is perfect for AR-platform rifles. It has a 2-inch diameter and is just 4-inches long, and it only weighs 8.6 ounces. The BANISH Speed K Ti is a .223/5.56-caliber suppressor with clipped-wall baffles and a finned blast chamber. Using controlled flow technology and a vented 4th baffle, the Speed K Ti minimizes gas blowback that allows for only a 5.8% increase in blowback from unsuppressed shooting, enabling rifles to function smoothly without additional modification.

All for free. Does a silencer count as barrel length? No, a silencer does not count as barrel length. A silencer will only count towards barrel length if it has been permanently pinned and welded on. There is not a good reason to attach a silencer permanently, since it reduces its usability and makes it harder to clean. The only real reason to do so is to lengthen your gun\u2019s barrel in order to avoid buying a SBR tax stamp. But usually, the cost to safely affix a silencer permanently is more than the cost of the stamp. Can you put a silencer on a rifle? Absolutely. In fact, rifles are by far the most common type of firearm on which to mount a silencer. Like rifles, silencers are common among hunters. Your hunting rifle should definitely have a silencer, because first and foremost, they reduce noise pollution. Meaning you\u2019re not going to scare off every critter in a 10 mile radius. But silencers also reduce recoil, muzzle blast, and the risk of hearing damage. They also are known to increase accuracy, helping you make that once-in-a-lifetime shot. Some rifles can also be integrally suppressed to reduce noise even more. They also have important safety benefits, like allowing you to be more aware of your surroundings. Without having to wear hearing protection, you can listen for sounds of other predators or hunters. Are .223/5.56 silencers illegal? No, .223/5.56 silencers are not illegal. You can very legally purchase and own a silencer in 42 of our 50 U.S. states. (If you are hoping to buy one in California, Illinois, New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Delaware, Hawaii, or Washington D.C. you would be out of luck!) If you are in the 42 states that have legalized silencers, you can trust that Silencer Central is there with you. We are licensed in all of those 42 states. Regulations are on a state-by-state basis, so take a look at our state-by-state guide on silencer ownership. Don\u2019t worry about traveling with your suppressor .

Testing shows the BANISH 45 suppresses a 9mm pistol by 36 decibels \u2013 far more sound reduction than the competition. Made with Titanium for the ultimate combination of durability and weight reduction, the BANISH 45 is the lightest in its class at a mere 9.6oz in the short configuration of 6.7\u201d. You can also run it in the long configuration of 8.6\u201d and still barely notice it\u2019s on your gun because it weighs only 11 oz. Because of the BANISH 45\u2019s modular design, you can run it with eight or 12 baffles, depending on your specific needs. Ideal for 3-gun or target shooting, the BANISH 45 will help protect the hearing of the shooter and others in a shooting competition and reduce recoil for quicker second shot target acquisition. User-serviceable from both ends, this suppressor can be easily and quickly disassembled for configuration changes and cleaning. You can easily clean the baffles by hand with a brush and your favorite solvent. Reassembly is just as easy, thanks to the keyed and indexed baffles. This guarantees that each one will be lined up perfectly for optimum performance. The unique design of the BANISH 45 makes it the one suppressor to fit any pistol caliber gun. Simply swap out the pistons (sold separately) and you can attach this suppressor to any multitude of pistols or pistol caliber carbines in your collection.

This includes .22 Hornet, .17HMR, and even 5.7\u00d728. It\u2019s even rated for full-auto! Using 1/2\u00d728 threads for direct attachment, the BANISH 22 is made of lightweight titanium, weighs just 4.1oz, is 1\u201d in diameter, and only 5 \u215c\u201d long. This means you\u2019ll barely even notice that the BANISH 22 is on the end of your gun \u2013 except when it comes to sound reduction. Tests have shown that the BANISH 22 brings the sound down to about 120 decibels, making it barely louder than a BB-gun. Essentially, this is as close to \u201cHollywood quiet\u201d as you can get. The Banish 22 at the muzzle tested at 116.8 dB on a 22LR with a 16\u2033 barrel and 117.6 dB at the muzzle on a Ruger Mark IV. Since rimfire ammo uses projectiles that are not jacketed, lead buildup and carbon fouling are a real concern in a rimfire silencer. Over time without cleaning, it\u2019s possible for a .22 suppressor to completely fill with lead and carbon, rendering it ineffective for sound suppression and adding considerable weight. The BANISH 22 was designed specifically to maximize your time shooting and minimize your time cleaning. Inside the tube are eight baffles that are engineered for a precise fit to keep lead debris and carbon buildup at an absolute minimum. This prevents the debris and buildup from reaching the tube, which causes components to fuse together. Once disassembled, cleaning couldn\u2019t be simpler: toss the baffles in a tumbler, ultrasonic cleaner, or use good, old-fashioned elbow grease. With indexing lines on each baffle for easy realignment and reassembly, the BANISH 22 is the only rimfire silencer on the market that is user-serviceable from both ends. If you\u2019re looking for the perfect first-time silencer purchase, the BANISH 22 is a great option. It\u2019s ideal for varmint shooting, small game hunting, target practice, and more.

The entire Banish lineup prides itself on being quiet and lightweight, but the Backcountry recently reviewed on AllOutdoor.com takes things to a different level. You get the same unmatched sound suppression and durable titanium construction as the flagship Banish 30 suppressor, but in a package that\u2019s shorter and lighter than ever before. The Backcountry is a fixed-length suppressor that measures 5.5\u201d in length (5.7 with mount) and weighs just 7.8 ounces. That\u2019s a full 1.3\u201d shorter and 2.2 ounces lighter than the Banish 30 in its short configuration. That may not sound like much, but it makes a world of difference for backcountry adventurers who carefully pack their gear with size and weight in mind. Rated for calibers up to the .300 Remington Ultra Magnum (RUM), the Banish Backcountry utilizes six baffles that drop the decibel level down to 135 dB for .308 Winchester, 137 dB for .300 Win Mag, and 138 dB for .300 RUM at the ear \u2013 all of which fall below the hearing-safe threshold. Utilizing a 1.375\u00d724 Universal Mount, the Banish Backcountry is a direct-thread suppressor designed to eliminate any extra weight associated with a muzzle device method of attachment, but it is also available with an optional muzzle brake attachment. When size, weight, and sound suppression are of the utmost concern, the Banish Backcountry suppressor allows you to pack in ounces, shoot at hearing-safe levels, and pack out pounds. All silencers require the purchase of a $200 Federal Tax Stamp.

Buck Commander is all about the thrill of the hunt and the relationships that come with it. Silencer Central is all about making your silencer purchase process as simple and hassle-free as possible so that you can spend more time thinking about your next hunt. The BUCK 30 is a multi-caliber suppressor that works with all rifle calibers up to .300 Winchester Magnum. That makes it the perfect choice for all of your hunting adventures no matter how big or small. Made of stainless steel and laser welded for precision and durability, the BUCK 30 features the Buck Commander logo proudly displayed on its tubeless construction. At just 6.9\u201d in length and 1.54\u201d in diameter, it weighs only 13.8 oz. Equipped with an accuracy baffle, the BUCK 30 minimizes point of impact shift so you may only need to make slight sight adjustments when you switch between suppressed and unsuppressed shooting. Additionally, the BUCK 30 features an industry-standard hub mount giving users more options to connect their BUCK 30 to their host firearm. Despite the compact size, it packs an impressive amount of sound suppression. Tests show that a .308 from an 18\u201d barrel registers 131 decibels at the ear. Similarly, 6.5 Creedmoor from a 20\u201d barrel registers 132 decibels at the ear. Both are well under the hearing-safe limit of 140 decibels. If you want to reduce your recoil, save your hearing, improve your accuracy, and protect your hunt, then you need the BUCK 30 on your rifle the next time you adventure beyond the pavement. All silencers require the purchase of a $200 Federal Tax Stamp.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "46da7dfc-c65a-479b-be81-52f5635ed69a": {"__data__": {"id_": "46da7dfc-c65a-479b-be81-52f5635ed69a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "scrape.txt", "file_name": "scrape.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 334689, "creation_date": "2024-07-10", "last_modified_date": "2024-07-02", "last_accessed_date": "2024-07-11"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "bd6b66b4-bb19-4515-b495-19f42d286bba", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "scrape.txt", "file_name": "scrape.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 334689, "creation_date": "2024-07-10", "last_modified_date": "2024-07-02", "last_accessed_date": "2024-07-11"}, "hash": "a7aaa12b0a6af5d4e7255e2fbb753b03068b049f0a6ab8d9a6ce618ad0c97590", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "830a92bf-e715-469b-8240-dec4cde4a1f1", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "scrape.txt", "file_name": "scrape.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 334689, "creation_date": "2024-07-10", "last_modified_date": "2024-07-02", "last_accessed_date": "2024-07-11"}, "hash": "5c807b41c98e75ee04ba5d9052625f5dfeb5e2bc5b6131008f629f8e274a5a15", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "d25c01d2-4aca-4b09-9cc2-5a23363005d4", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "scrape.txt", "file_name": "scrape.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 334689, "creation_date": "2024-07-10", "last_modified_date": "2024-07-02", "last_accessed_date": "2024-07-11"}, "hash": "8232643053ec05379d93443f2fedaf2176655edd76333cd1465309cc559b4ac5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "763d5ff063ba75f9c65afb3a328f83c1ef0beabf50fe3e3d68147dd91c98c521", "text": "Additionally, the BUCK 30 features an industry-standard hub mount giving users more options to connect their BUCK 30 to their host firearm.

Most suppressors are made for a threaded barrel, so you\u2019ll need to find a different way to attach it. There are threading adapters on the market, but the best way to attach a silencer to a non-threaded barrel is to get your barrel threaded. Here at Silencer Central, we have our own threading service, where you can send us your barrel and get it threaded starting at $99.99. Can a .308 suppressor be used on .223?

More details\nFeatured Section: \nTabs:\n  - Description & specs For the shooter who wants modular capabilities and multi-caliber compatibility without needing to accommodate big bore rifles, the SilencerCo Omega 36M fits the bill perfectly. Offering multiple configurations for length, weight, and mounting options, the Omega 36M has a two-piece modular design that allows for the removal of the front section. This provides the shooter with a shorter and lighter suppressor that still offers impressive sound performance. With the front section removed, the Omega 36M short configuration measures 4.90\u201d and weighs just 9.8 ounces. The long configuration is 6.85\u201d and weighs 12.5 ounces. Made of stainless steel, titanium, and Cobalt 6, both long and short configurations of the Omega 36M are full-auto rated. The Omega 36M offers great versatility for pistols, subguns, and rifles, without sacrificing performance. Tests show 9mm is brought down to 123.3dB and 5.56/.223 is brought down to 130.6dB. The Omega 36M is rated down to 10\u201d barrels for .223 REM/5.56 NATO, 16\u201d barrels for .308 WIN/7.62 NATO, and 20\u201d barrels for .300 Win Mag and .338 Lapua Magnum.

The Salvo 12 is designed to operate with nearly all shotguns and ammunition on the market today including pump actions, semi autos, and inertia driven models. Due to the modularity of the Salvo 12, the shooter can remove sections to balance their sound suppression, weight, and length needs and can attach the Salvo to their favorite shotgun with choke mounts available in improved cylinder, modified, improved modified, and full. This adaptability makes the Salvo 12 ideal for use with sporting clays, waterfowl, turkey hunting, home defense, and everything in between. At its full length of 12 inches, sound is brought down to 136.8 dB at the muzzle \u2014 well below the 140 dB hearing-safe threshold set by OSHA. Pair this sound reduction with a noticeable decrease in felt recoil, and after just a few rounds through the Salvo 12, you\u2019ll never go back to shooting unsuppressed again. Attaches via choke mount to most commercially available gas operated, inertia driven, or pump action shotguns with barrels threaded for chokes. Modular design allow the user to shorten the silencer to 6\u2033, 8\u2033, or 10\u2033 configurations to balance size, weight, and sound requirements. Rate for wadded shells up to 3\u2033 including buckshot and slugs. Can be shortened to 8\u2033 configuration and remain hearing safe at the ear. Noticeably reduces felt recoil. Choke mounts and rod kits sold separately \u2013 choke mounts available in improved cylinder, modified, improved modified and full.

This perfectly-engineered marvel includes a key element no other suppressor has ever incorporated: its own auxiliary two-port muzzle brake which reduces the recoil of suppressed fire. When minimal visible signature is required, the bolted-on auxiliary muzzle brake can be easily removed. The Barrett QDL Suppressor\u2019s dual layered tube is constructed of heat treated high strength alloys. This, combined with redundant 360 degree welding, makes it the safest large bore suppressor on the market. By simply sliding the Suppressor over the muzzle brake directly into the indexing point, proper alignment is guaranteed every time. Once in place, the Barrett unique lock-ring coupler clicks into ratchet grooves for a secure fit that nothing can shake. In fact, the entire system is designed to ensure perfect consistency with every installation in seconds.

Thread pitches-\u00a0 M25x1.5, 1 x 14 or 7/8 x 14. Made for bolt action, non-semi automatic 50 BMG rifles. This suppressor is not suitable for the Barrett semi-auto M82A1, M107, or M107A1. The AR50 uses the factory brake collar to attach and time this suppressor. For light weight .50cal rifles (such as the Barrett 99), user will feel a slight increase in felt recoil. .50cal suppressor can be used on the EDM ARMS M96 408cal. For .50 caliber bolt action rifles and depending upon an individual shooter\u2019s experience, perceived recoil for suppressors is slightly more than with a muzzle brake. The actual visual of the flash signature from a suppressor at 50 yards and forward of the muzzle at a 45\u00b0 angle is approximately the same as the striking of a BIC lighter. Thread: 1\u00d714 or 7/8\u00d714 Both the shooter and observer will be please with the sound reduction when the Alpha suppressor is in use. However, the sound you will be hearing is still above the safe hearing threshold. It is highly recommended that some type of hearing protection is used when firing the weapon. Users frequently complain about a change of the point of impact between a rifle with and without a sound suppressor installed.

One of the main drawbacks to shooting a semi-auto rifle with a suppressor is the gas blowback that can hit the shooter in the face. Instead of relying on special charging handles or other products to mitigate the issue, the SilencerCo Velos LBP (Low Back-Pressure) was designed for optimal performance from a 5.56mm suppressor. Incorporating state-of-the-art manufacturing processes, such as a 3D-printed Inconel, the core of the Velos LBP is fully welded to the 17-4 front and rear modules. Coming in at just 5.98\u201d long and weighing 15.2 ounces, there\u2019s nothing else like it on the market today. Equipped with a Hoplon blast baffle, no barrel length restrictions, and a full-auto rating, the Velos LBP is the most durable suppressor SilencerCo has ever made. Pair it with existing SilencerCo Charlie accessories and you\u2019re ready to shoot with less back pressure. All silencers require the purchase of a $200 Federal Tax Stamp.

Presently, we don\u2019t know how much faster it will be. With that said, our research based on previous electronic Form 4 approvals and the current electronic Form 1 approvals suggests that once this process gets rolling, the total time needed to secure a transfer approval of a silencer should be reduced from the current 10 months (or more) wait time, to an approximate 150 days.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0fd30361-6445-4a50-a588-d448c6b5fced": {"__data__": {"id_": "0fd30361-6445-4a50-a588-d448c6b5fced", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "scrape.txt", "file_name": "scrape.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 334689, "creation_date": "2024-07-10", "last_modified_date": "2024-07-02", "last_accessed_date": "2024-07-11"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "bd6b66b4-bb19-4515-b495-19f42d286bba", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "scrape.txt", "file_name": "scrape.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 334689, "creation_date": "2024-07-10", "last_modified_date": "2024-07-02", "last_accessed_date": "2024-07-11"}, "hash": "a7aaa12b0a6af5d4e7255e2fbb753b03068b049f0a6ab8d9a6ce618ad0c97590", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "265f90cf-07c8-415d-806c-c5aefab0e141", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "scrape.txt", "file_name": "scrape.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 334689, "creation_date": "2024-07-10", "last_modified_date": "2024-07-02", "last_accessed_date": "2024-07-11"}, "hash": "8cc172ae0ac2095642932a1233ceb5383728d61b06bf28b5634dd2dbe2ce2d96", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "5e535ce4-8d3e-45f4-97a6-c48b212d38b4", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "scrape.txt", "file_name": "scrape.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 334689, "creation_date": "2024-07-10", "last_modified_date": "2024-07-02", "last_accessed_date": "2024-07-11"}, "hash": "7fb363425838c182a617dda2ff1238d4892ec8dd7569384feed2fdfbcf292567", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "5dd464fc7790d974252dff56ecb2406c60577e748a940061d5f392d5ac4fc475", "text": "2.

You will then receive your username from the ATF (they pick it, you do not) and choose a password and PIN (you pick it, they do not).You will still provide us all of your personal information, your fingerprints and your photo. The biggest change is on Silencer Central\u2019s side as we will now submit all of your information electronically through the eForms website AND your wait time will significantly decrease.\n\nTitle: How will the Electronic Form 4 speed up the process?\nText: The ATF\u2019s new electronic version of theForm 4will greatly expedite the time required to make these transfers. When a transfer applicant or dealer enters the data electronically, the data will now be transmitted digitally. This cuts out the repetitive need for data entry and validation.Electronic Form 4 submissions should arrive at the ATF instantaneously, ready for the approval process. All of the time needed for data entry will be cut from the processing time.\n\nTitle: If I file as an individual, can I add a trust at a later date?\nText: Yes, you can add any silencer to a trust after you buy it by filing as an individual. Just keep in mind a few things. You will need to have legal help is setting up the new trust and adding in the silencer. There will likely be fees involved, but we can\u2019t predict what those will be. There is also the issue of a tax stamp. If you transfer your silencer to a trust, you will need to buy a new tax stamp for it under the trust, according to the ATF.\n\nTitle: If I file as an individual, will I really get my silencer faster?\nText: The short answer is yes, you likely will \u2013 for now. Approval times for trusts are speeding up, and batch approvals are happening, too. We have been working with the ATF to help make the process for trusts faster, but individual approvals are currently faster.\n\nTitle: Is Silencer Central ready for eForms?\nText: Yes, all of our processes are ready and in-place. Not only have we been very involved with the ATF in beta testing for this NEW ATF eForm 4 process, but Silencer Central was also one of the primary companies invited to the final testing and feedback session for eForms.\n\nTitle: What does this mean for my current order?\nText: 1. If you have already started your application through the paper-process, then you will need to stay on that path. It is not recommended to withdraw paper applications. Remember: you\u2019re already in line, so why jump out and go to the back of a different one?2. ATF has stated that any withdrawals of pending paper applications will result in a one-year delay.\n\nTitle: What if I get approved before my eZ-Pay Plan is complete?\nText: Our interest free eZ-Pay plan is extremely popular at Silencer Central. We will continue to allow you to \u201cpay for it while you wait for it.\u201d\u00a0 If you are approved before your payment plan is complete, simply pay off your balance and have your silencer shipped directly to your door.\n\nTitle: What if my paperwork has already been submitted to the ATF?\nText: If you have already started your application through the paper-process, then you will need to stay on that path. It is not recommended to withdraw paper applications.\n\nTitle: What if you don\u2019t want to file electronically?\nText: The paper version will still be an option. If for any reason you decide you would rather submit on paper, you certainly can, and Silencer Central can still do that on your behalf as we have been doing for years.

The wait time will remain similar to what it is currently.\n\nTitle: What is ATF Form 4 eForm?\nText: ATF electronic Form 4\u2019s will change the Form 4 from a paper process to an entirely digital process. Silencer Central will submit everything to the ATF digitally and the ATF will send their approval digitally. This will speed up the process of buying and waiting for approval.\n\nTitle: What is the new pin number process and how do I set it up?\nText: The most important change that the ATF has made is the usage and creation of a PIN that will help submit your form digitally. This process will be similar to the pins that have been used for years with ATF Forms 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.To create an eForms account, visiteforms.atf.govto start the process. You will then receive your username from the ATF (they pick it, you do not) and choose a password and PIN (you pick it, they do not).\n\nTitle: What makes paper-based Form 4 transfers so slow?\nText: There are two logical answers to this question. The first is the time it takes for paperwork to make it through the mail, and with postal reliability these days, there\u2019s no telling when your paperwork may actually arrive. Thankfully, that\u2019s now a thing of the past!The second reason is the amount of time devoted to data entry. When a silencer dealer or individual sends completed paperwork to the ATF to secure permission for a Form 4 transfer, employees at the ATF have to manually enter the data from the forms. (Yes, that\u2019s right: the ATF takes your paper form and enters it into a computer instead of just having you enter it electronically in the first place.)As you can imagine, this is a time-consuming process. The data must be entered, and then checked, and this process is typically taking upwards of 9 months as of the time of writing.\n\nTitle: Which is better - Trust or Individual?\nText: The real answer to this is that it is entirely up to you. Only you can decide what works best for your circumstances. It\u2019s pretty obvious that we tend to prefer trusts for the flexibility they provide. That\u2019s why we offer trust setup as a free service. However, we also see the benefit to individual filing, as you will likely get your silencer faster.\u00a0 Go through all the pros and cons to each and just know that we\u2019re here to help you regardless of what you choose.\n\nTitle: Will ATF eForms reduce wait times?\nText: Yes, we anticipate a significant decrease in wait times once the ATF eForm 4 is launched.\n\nTitle: Will filing as a trust ever be as fast as filing as an individual?\nText: That is the goal that we and the ATF are working toward. We are always looking at how we can optimize our process, and we work with the ATF to see what can be done better. The ATF has told us that they are adding more staff and are working toward having the approval process be as close to equal as possible. But it isn\u2019t there yet. We will keep everyone informed.\n\nTitle: With eForms, will Silencer Central still be able to ship directly to my door?\nText: The eForms process only enhances Silencer Central\u2019s process. We will still have the ability to mail your silencer directly to you. The variances we have with the ATF have allowed us to run most of our processes digitally so the only piece that is changing is we will now submit your application electronically to the ATF.\n\nTitle: Which is better - Trust or Individual?\nText: The real answer to this is that it is entirely up to you.

We will still have the ability to mail your silencer directly to you. The variances we have with the ATF have allowed us to run most of our processes digitally so the only piece that is changing is we will now submit your application electronically to the ATF.\n\nTitle: Which is better - Trust or Individual?\nText: The real answer to this is that it is entirely up to you. Only you can decide what works best for your circumstances. It\u2019s pretty obvious that we tend to prefer trusts for the flexibility they provide.

However, we also see the benefit to individual filing, as you will likely get your silencer faster.\u00a0 Go through all the pros and cons to each and just know that we\u2019re here to help you regardless of what you choose.\n\nTitle: Why Are Silencers (Suppressors) in Such High Demand?\nText: Until recently, most Americans thought silencers were illegal. There are many benefits: better hunting, no hearing protection, reduced recoil, better accuracy, and happy neighbors. This market segment is the fastest growing in the firearms industry; we have been in this market exclusively since 2005.\n\nTitle: What Are the Benefits of Owning a Silencer?\nText: There are countless benefits of owning a silencer, a few of which include:Better Experience\u2013 Game is less likely to spook while hunting.Reduces Recoil\u2013 Significantly reduces recoil when you shoot.Increased Accuracy\u2013 Because of recoil reduction.Less Noise\u2013 Means you won\u2019t disrupt neighbors, family or pets.Great for Family\u2013 Added safety for even the youngest family members.\n\nTitle: How Do You Choose Which Silencers to Keep in Stock?\nText: Through our over 12 years of experience in the silencer marketplace, we\u2019ve found customers have three main issues driving their purchasing decisions:Best sound reductionBest value for the price; andLightest weight for shooting convenienceDue to customer demand for these three types of silencers, we carry a large volume in each category. Of course, we\u2019re also here to provide any other silencer you may want. As such, we can order any manufacturer\u2019s silencer to ensure you have everything you need.When you\u2019re browsing your options, please note that a higher price doesn\u2019t automatically mean that a silencer will be quieter. Large manufacturers commonly compromise value to mass produce in large volumes and turn larger profits (meaning you\u2019ll pay more for less quality). As always, you can contact our staff between 8:30 a.m. and 5 p.m. during the week and after hours via email to assist with the purchasing process if you aren\u2019t sure which silencer is right for you. Please tap into our experience and expertise.\n\nTitle: How Do You Test Your Silencers?\nText: At Silencer Central, we sell only the best, so we test with only the best. Currently, we test each of our silencers with a Bruel & Kjaer 2209 military grade sound testing meter that meets all military standards for silencer testing.As the only silencer dealer in the country with this testing meter and one of only a few manufacturers with it, we can guarantee the quality of our products due to our rigorous testing process. We don\u2019t carry any silencers that don\u2019t meet our strict criteria and as such, you can purchase any of our products with confidence.\n\nTitle: Are Silencers as Quiet as on the Movies?\nText: The only silencer as quiet in real life as it appears in movies is the.22 rimfire. All other calibers will sound like a .22 short to a .22 long when suppressed. However, every silencer we sell is hearing safe, meaning you won\u2019t need additional hearing protection. See thesilencer sound chartby caliber.\n\nTitle: Am I \"grandfathered\" in after I purchase my first suppressor?\nText: No, when you purchase your next suppressor you will still need to complete the ATF application process, pay the $200 tax stamp, and wait for approval. However, Silencer Central keeps your fingerprints and passport-style photo on file in a secured location making the preparation of your application on future purchases fast and simple.\n\nTitle: If I file as an individual, can I add a trust at a later date?\nText: Yes, you can add any silencer to a trust after you buy it by filing as an individual. Just keep in mind a few things. You will need to have legal help is setting up the new trust and adding in the silencer. There will likely be fees involved, but we can\u2019t predict what those will be.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f9809425-86c3-420c-96e3-00471f9b8398": {"__data__": {"id_": "f9809425-86c3-420c-96e3-00471f9b8398", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "scrape.txt", "file_name": "scrape.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 334689, "creation_date": "2024-07-10", "last_modified_date": "2024-07-02", "last_accessed_date": "2024-07-11"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "bd6b66b4-bb19-4515-b495-19f42d286bba", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "scrape.txt", "file_name": "scrape.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 334689, "creation_date": "2024-07-10", "last_modified_date": "2024-07-02", "last_accessed_date": "2024-07-11"}, "hash": "a7aaa12b0a6af5d4e7255e2fbb753b03068b049f0a6ab8d9a6ce618ad0c97590", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "84f5121d-8297-40d7-8418-0bf32109fe62", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "scrape.txt", "file_name": "scrape.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 334689, "creation_date": "2024-07-10", "last_modified_date": "2024-07-02", "last_accessed_date": "2024-07-11"}, "hash": "53086c8fe77ff5707f9cceb04531aadb4cf1b8a0ae215a6ab4491a7e76de38b4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "29b1294e-1187-4781-96aa-4510e711d8fa", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "scrape.txt", "file_name": "scrape.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 334689, "creation_date": "2024-07-10", "last_modified_date": "2024-07-02", "last_accessed_date": "2024-07-11"}, "hash": "0f1a8fc487b883ea33f53d296951e406d6989d926b714baf52eccfc372c437ac", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "a4da80be62bccccdf4c1c6c4ae4cf4b69698ef3c8e5b9f286cfb4105a11e4338", "text": "See thesilencer sound chartby caliber.\n\nTitle: Am I \"grandfathered\" in after I purchase my first suppressor?\nText: No, when you purchase your next suppressor you will still need to complete the ATF application process, pay the $200 tax stamp, and wait for approval.

We are always looking at how we can optimize our process, and we work with the ATF to see what can be done better. The ATF has told us that they are adding more staff and are working toward having the approval process be as close to equal as possible. But it isn\u2019t there yet. We will keep everyone informed.\n\nTitle: What is a NFA Gun Trust?\nText: Silencer Central provides aFREE NFA Trustwith the purchase of each silencer.NFA trustsallow sharing ownership of silencers with others.Trusts ensure the next generation inherits your suppressor.We have done over 15,000 gun trust silencer transfers and counting!We keep on file for future purchases.The gun trust is 20 plus pages and allows you to add unlimited co-trustees to also use your silencers or other NFA items.

Doing so is very common with a stacked baffle design, like theBANISH 30.Having one silencer for all rifle applications doesn\u2019t often impact performance because.308 silencersare longer with additional baffles. Due to its light weight, titanium is one of the most popular materials for application on all sub calibers. Please note that not all.308 silencerswork well on a .223. Stack baffle design is typically best for dual application because there is a greater surface area to remove heat from the blast.In recent tests, we found that our own exclusive silencer, theBANISH 30, was quieter on a .223 than a.223 silencerwas. Additionally, we have tested some silencers that are not hearing safe on all sub-calibers. As such, it\u2019s best to ask our staff if you have a specific question about certain models.\n\nTitle: How Do I Get My Silencer After It Has Been Approved?\nText: Once we have received your approval from the ATF, we will send you an email and a text message informing you of the next steps to have your silencer(s) shipped to your front door:You will need to complete and sign the ATF form 4473. This is a federally required form that allows us to transfer ownership of your silencer(s) to you. We will first send you a link via email to complete the form electronically, then you will receive a second email to review and sign the document.Next, we are required to send a notification via certified mail to the chief law enforcement officer in your jurisdiction, letting them know we will be shipping your silencer(s) to you. Once we receive confirmation this notification has been received, the chief law enforcement officer has seven days to respond. We cannot ship until after the seven days has passed.You will receive two shipping notifications and two tracking numbers.

Please note: Adult signature is required at the time of delivery.\n\nTitle: How do I take a passport-style photo?\nText: Your ATF Form 4 application must include a passport style photo. Here are some tips to take the best picture.The image will be cropped to a 2\u2033x2\u2033 square size.The photo should be taken in front of a solid white background.Photos must be taken in full face view. The top of your head and your shoulders need to be in full view (there should be white space above your head).Remove any head coverings that would obscure your hair or hairline, including sunglasses, hats, toupees.Submit your photo via email tophotos@silencercentral.comand include your First, Middle, Last name.\n\nTitle: If I file as an individual, will I really get my silencer faster?\nText: The short answer is yes, you likely will \u2013 for now. Approval times for trusts are speeding up, and batch approvals are happening, too. We have been working with the ATF to help make the process for trusts faster, but individual approvals are currently faster.\n\nTitle: Which is better - Trust or Individual?\nText: The real answer to this is that it is entirely up to you. Only you can decide what works best for your circumstances. It\u2019s pretty obvious that we tend to prefer trusts for the flexibility they provide.

To discuss further benefits of a Gun Trust, contact a member of our team at888-781-8778.\n\nTitle: Do I Need to Have a Class 3 License to Purchase a Silencer?\nText: No! The best way to think of a silencer purchase is as a \u201ctitle\u201d transfer between our company and your Gun Trust or to you directly. While ATF must approve this transfer (which we will assist with), you do not physically need your own license to make a purchase.\n\nTitle: Is There a Federal Tax Involved in Purchasing a Silencer?\nText: There is a$200 Tax Stamprequired per silencer. This fee is tax deductible and is a one-time fee. The best way to conceptualize this fee is as a title transfer tax.\n\nTitle: Can I Order Any Silencer From Any Manufacturer From You?\nText: Absolutely!

In fact, rifles are by far the most common type of firearm on which to mount a silencer. Like rifles, silencers are common among hunters. Your hunting rifle should definitely have a silencer, because first and foremost, they reduce noise pollution. Meaning you\u2019re not going to scare off every critter in a 10 mile radius.But silencers also reduce recoil, muzzle blast, and the risk of hearing damage. They also are known to increase accuracy, helping you make that once-in-a-lifetime shot. Some rifles can also be integrally suppressed to reduce noise even more. They also have important safety benefits, like allowing you to be more aware of your surroundings. Without having to wear hearing protection, you can listen for sounds of other predators or hunters.\n\nTitle: What is the quietest rifle suppressor?\nText: Well the jury\u2019s out on this one, because there is so much that affects asuppressor\u2019s dB testingat any given time. A gunshot\u2019s volume, measured in decibels, or \u201cdB\u201d, depends on the weight, caliber, and speed of the bullet, the length of the barrel, not to mention how fast the gunpowder is burning. A gunshot can also be impacted by something as simple as temperature or humidity.Price is not necessarily indicative of quality. But material is. The best suppressors are made out of 100% titanium. Titanium is both lightweight and quicker at cooling hot muzzle gas than steel or aluminum.If we had to choose a quietest silencer to recommend, we\u2019d suggest theBANISH 30multi-caliber suppressor, because it has the highest sound reduction in comparison to its competitors of similar weight and material.\n\nTitle: What is the best rifle suppressor?\nText: What is the best rifle suppressor? This is up for debate, but we\u2019re partial to the BANISH line of silencers. BANISH suppressors are the original multi-caliber suppressors, making them incredibly versatile and able to fit more than just one gun. OurBANISH suppressorswere designed to be most user friendly silencers on the market, without sacrificing quality.When buying a suppressor, you should make sure to think about what caliber you need, what material it\u2019s made out of, how it will impact your performance (ie. point-of-impact shift, velocity, recoil), whether you need a threaded barrel, if you\u2019re interested in subsonic shooting, getting the paperwork done with the ATF, and price.You should also consider how and why you\u2019ll be using it. Are you hoping to reduce noise pollution? Increase the accuracy of your shots? Trying to reduce the risk of hearing loss? All these factors will contribute to the type of silencer that works best for you.\n\nTitle: How do rifle suppressors work?\nText: When you fire a round, burning gas builds up pressure behind the bullet and thrusts it down your bore. When the bullet leaves, a burst of host gas exists behind it, releasing a loud noise.In comes a silencer. A silencer slows down the gas by redirecting it through a series of baffles before it can escape the silencer. This allows any unburnt powder to finish burning off, which reduces muzzle flash. It also gives the gas more time to slow down and cool, so that when it does escape the silencer, it\u2019s moving slower and under less pressure, which means it\u2019s also quieter.If you want to learn more about how silencers work and get into the nitty gritty, check out our article,\u201cAn Inside Look at How Suppressors Work\u201d.\n\nTitle: How do I choose the right rifle silencer?\nText: Choosing the right silencer can be complicated. There are a ton of different factors that come into play, including ones you may not have thought about. These include things like material, weight, length, caliber compatibility, price, and whether or not it\u2019s threaded.You might also want to consider how you are using it.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "dd8ad174-c2ff-4c00-8f4f-fc8a9c368937": {"__data__": {"id_": "dd8ad174-c2ff-4c00-8f4f-fc8a9c368937", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "scrape.txt", "file_name": "scrape.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 334689, "creation_date": "2024-07-10", "last_modified_date": "2024-07-02", "last_accessed_date": "2024-07-11"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "bd6b66b4-bb19-4515-b495-19f42d286bba", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "scrape.txt", "file_name": "scrape.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 334689, "creation_date": "2024-07-10", "last_modified_date": "2024-07-02", "last_accessed_date": "2024-07-11"}, "hash": "a7aaa12b0a6af5d4e7255e2fbb753b03068b049f0a6ab8d9a6ce618ad0c97590", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "8564e752-83ee-4e54-96ae-7b144095e84d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "scrape.txt", "file_name": "scrape.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 334689, "creation_date": "2024-07-10", "last_modified_date": "2024-07-02", "last_accessed_date": "2024-07-11"}, "hash": "03c892b2838d8090f58fb4a2849448b3fcf6d776164547d2261c9c2a92152a84", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "83378ee3-d2ac-44e0-ab62-008ff461c174", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "scrape.txt", "file_name": "scrape.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 334689, "creation_date": "2024-07-10", "last_modified_date": "2024-07-02", "last_accessed_date": "2024-07-11"}, "hash": "221060f73f0181de9f675142d0ff94d80a734e049c0bc5124e94f4ca80b842e7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "4c6f0eee495058f45986e34a856fe9cc539241266d93b501ee8a1eb1dc3c7f2d", "text": "A silencer slows down the gas by redirecting it through a series of baffles before it can escape the silencer.

These include things like material, weight, length, caliber compatibility, price, and whether or not it\u2019s threaded.You might also want to consider how you are using it. Is your silencer going on a rifle or a .22? Is it a hunting rifle, or one you keep for protection? What are your goals? To reduce the risk of hearing loss? Have less noise pollution?

Our sales staff will walk you through the process from start to finish, from choosing the right silencer, to filling out the paperwork, and getting it in your hands.\n\nTitle: Are pistol silencers legal?\nText: Yes, pistol silencers are legal. Silencers, while regulated, actually make guns safer for everyone. They reduce the risk of hearing loss, allowing gun owners to operate without earplugs, which in turn, helps them be much more aware of their surroundings.So yes. With the exception of 8 states (California, Illinois, New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Delaware, Hawaii), and one federal district, Washington D.C, owning suppressors is legal in the United States of America. If you want to know more about the specific regulations on silencers in your state, read ourstate-by-state guide on silencer ownership.And if the process seems a little daunting, don\u2019t worry. Silencer Central is here to help you navigate the buying process, wait time, and paperwork. We\u2019re licensed in all 42 states where pistol silencers are legal.\n\nTitle: Do pistol silencers work?\nText: Yes, absolutely. Silencers offer many of the same benefits to pistol shooters as they do to rifle and shotgun shooters. Even thebest Pistol silencerstend to get a bad rap because unlike rifles or shotguns, pistols are often bought to conceal or be discreet.However, a suppressed pistol is a great training aid. Suppressors reduce recoil and noise flinch. A silencer makes a gun safer and more manageable, with less risk of hearing loss, and allows you to take off your hearing protection and be aware of the space around you. A silencer also reduces noise pollution, recoil, and muzzle flash, and increases accuracy. In some cases, it might even increase the velocity of the bullet.\n\nTitle: How loud is a silenced pistol?\nText: How loud a suppressed pistol is depends greatly upon the caliber being fired and the suppressor being used. Unlike in the movies, a silencer won\u2019t give you a completely soundless bullet whispering through the air. The word \u201csuppressor\u201d is really more accurate because these products suppress the sound of a gun rather than silence it.That said, the level of sound suppression you typically get from a silencer is between 20 \u2013 36 dB. Which is enough to significantly reduce the risk of hearing damage. Essentially, suppressors make guns just quiet enough to reduce most or all of the downsides associated with extremely loud gunshots.See our article abouthow we test our silencersfor more information.\n\nTitle: Is 45 ACP quieter than 9mm?\nText: A .45 ACP and a 9mm blast will likely sound very similar. That said, a suppressed .45 ACP will likely be quieter than asuppressed 9mm.But this is actually a very complicated question to answer because it depends on more than ammunition.

That said, a suppressed .45 ACP will likely be quieter than asuppressed 9mm.But this is actually a very complicated question to answer because it depends on more than ammunition. It will also depend on the gun, barrel length, silencer being used, and more uncontrollable factors like the weather and humidity.Technically, because standard .45 ACP ammo is subsonic, it is more effectively suppressed than 9mm ammo. 9mm is actually what can be called \u201csupersonic\u201d, which means that it breaks the sound barrier. Supersonic bullets are generally louder because a suppressor cannot quiet the sonic \u201ccrack,\u201d so a suppressor will probably do more for a 45 ACP than a 9mm.That being said, it really will depend on more factors than just ammo, and the difference we\u2019re talking about here is small. In general, it\u2019s best to use hearing protection when shooting a gun. But both a silenced .45 ACP and silenced 9mm will be below 140 dB, the OSHA threshold for hearing damage.\n\nTitle: What is the quietest 9mm suppressor?\nText: In our opinion, the best pistol silencer is aBANISH 45, since its interchangeable piston mounting system makes it so versatile. Its lightweight titanium body and great sound reduction make it easily a great option for a 9mm.We also like the Illusion 9. Illusion 9\u2019s unique design allows shooters to see easier and effectively use the standard iron sights on the pistol. The downside is, of course, that it is only available for a 9mm, so is less versatile.For a full breakdown, check out our 2020 round-up ofbest pistol silencers.\n\nTitle: What pistols can have silencers?\nText: Most standard pistols can be used with silencers, but we recommend talking with our team to know for sure if your pistol is ideal for being used with a silencer.

INDIVIDUAL\u00a0 filing \u2013 WHICH DO YOU CHOOSE?\n\nDue to popular demand, we have added the option to submit your eForm 4 to the ATF as an individual or as a trust. You are given the opportunity to select from both during checkout. There are several pros and cons to each, but the main thing to keep in mind is this \u2013 Individual filing offers speed of approval, while the trust offers more flexibility for you. We understand that this can be a harder decision. Of course, we want you to be completely informed and comfortable, so we added a lot of informationlaying out both in a separate post.\n\nAll of the information that is needed to purchase your suppressor \u2013 your name, pertinent info, address, make, model, and serial number of the suppressor, etc. \u2013 is also needed to register your suppressor with an NFA gun trust. Since we have all of that information from you to facilitate the purchase, we can easily use that information to create your free NFA gun trust.\n\nWhile we obviously prefer the trust option, so much so that we made it a free service we offer, you don\u2019t have to use it. You can also file as an individual or even as a corporation. There arebenefits and drawbacksto each of the three options, so if you\u2019re not sure, give us a call and we can figure out what is best for your specific situation. That said, 99.5% of our customers end up using our free gun trust. It is entirely up to you.\n\nIS IT REALLY FREE?\n\nYes, it really is free! When you buy a silencer from Silencer Central, your trust is free. That\u2019s our little way of saying thank you for your business.\n\nThis Gun Trust is 20-plus pages and allows you to add unlimited co-trustees to also use your silencers or other NFA items. We offer this Gun Trust FREE if you purchase a silencer from Silencer Central. We also help ensure you completed the gun trust correctly so ATF does not reject it. We have completed over 15,000 silencers to gun trust transfers and counting.\n\nHOW DO GUN TRUSTS WORK?\n\nBuying a suppressor in the name of a gun trust is very popular, and comes with a number of advantages. It gives you options for how you use your suppressor and peace of mind.\n\n- Each person on the trust may possess the silencer. That means you can let your spouse, family member, or even a trusted friend use the silencer without added paperwork or needing to be in your presence. If you filed as an individual, youmustbe present when anyone else uses your silencer, which can be a pain.\n- Just because a gun trust is a legal document doesn\u2019t mean your decisions are final and locked in forever. You can change the trust anytime you need to \u2013 without letting the BATFE know. This lets you add or remove people at your leisure.\n- Once you form a trust, you can use it again and again when buying other silencers or NFA items. Trusts make legacy planning easy. Just add the person you want to inherit the silencer to your trust.\n\nHow does filing as an individual work?", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5bed1293-cf56-4caa-86ae-019ac141580a": {"__data__": {"id_": "5bed1293-cf56-4caa-86ae-019ac141580a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "scrape.txt", "file_name": "scrape.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 334689, "creation_date": "2024-07-10", "last_modified_date": "2024-07-02", "last_accessed_date": "2024-07-11"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "bd6b66b4-bb19-4515-b495-19f42d286bba", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "scrape.txt", "file_name": "scrape.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 334689, "creation_date": "2024-07-10", "last_modified_date": "2024-07-02", "last_accessed_date": "2024-07-11"}, "hash": "a7aaa12b0a6af5d4e7255e2fbb753b03068b049f0a6ab8d9a6ce618ad0c97590", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "f92a27c0-ca59-4250-b8e5-bb3580e0ac49", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "scrape.txt", "file_name": "scrape.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 334689, "creation_date": "2024-07-10", "last_modified_date": "2024-07-02", "last_accessed_date": "2024-07-11"}, "hash": "013c0e34af12a02fc001090373f14419cbb7f05ab01191cf7757c862e4c205ec", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "aa2bd2b3-41d2-4c11-8f5f-3173c7d5393f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "scrape.txt", "file_name": "scrape.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 334689, "creation_date": "2024-07-10", "last_modified_date": "2024-07-02", "last_accessed_date": "2024-07-11"}, "hash": "510b7961d3137c789410251a1f96904ce967944fdb7b48ffbefffa20616a9ace", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "a2f0035647bebfa7f9346912f5efa7ccd75f100a25dafee3de9944b293383d70", "text": "It gives you options for how you use your suppressor and peace of mind.\n\n- Each person on the trust may possess the silencer.

Just add the person you want to inherit the silencer to your trust.\n\nHow does filing as an individual work?\n\nIt does simplify things a little, due to less paperwork being involved. Like we said, you simply select individual during checkout and we take it from there. Because the ATF is super-fast on turnaround time for approvals right now, you will likely get your suppressor much faster with an individual application. If you have succession planning for firearms in your will, depending upon wording, a trust may be redundant. Unless you set it up with us as part of our free service during the purchase process, trusts can be expensive, too. If you didn\u2019t want to spend to create a trust in addition to the costs of the tax stamp and the suppressor purchase price, an individual application may be very appealing.\n\nThe downfall to individual filing is losing the flexibility to say who can use your suppressor. You suppressor has to be in your possession, so loaning one to a buddy means you have to be with it all of the time.\u00a0 If you want to addyour silencer(s) to a trust in the future, it will require a new Form 4 and an additional $200 tax stamp per silencer.\n\nSTAY CONNECTED\n\nFREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS ABOUT THE SUPPRESSOR BUYING PROCESS\n\nBuying a suppressor isn\u2019t hard, but that doesn\u2019t mean that there aren\u2019t some common questions that most first-time buyers have. In all the years we\u2019ve been in this business, we\u2019ve gotten pretty good at knowing what the most frequently asked questions are about the suppressor buying process.\n\nHOW LONG DOES IT TAKE TO BUY A SUPPRESSOR?\n\nBuying a suppressor doesn\u2019t take long at all. It\u2019s fairly simple to fill out all of the forms and paperwork,submit your fingerprintsand photo, etc. Getting approval for your suppressor from the ATF after you buy it, however, takes a little longer.\n\nHOW DO I BUY A SUPPRESSOR TAX STAMP?\n\nBuying a suppressor tax stamp is an easy and automatic part of the buying process since your approved forms from the ATF cannot be completed without buying the stamp. They cost $200 and are added to your invoice when you buy from us or any other dealer.\n\nHOW DO I BUY A SUPPRESSOR ONLINE?\n\nBy now, you know that the whole \u201cbuy a gun online\u201d thing the way it\u2019s portrayed in the media is 100% false. Still, you can buy guns online. In that same vein, youcanbuy a suppressor online. You can even fill out all of the paperwork online, too. However, the purchase is still governed by the NFA branch of the ATF, so it\u2019s not like you can just add it to your cart and have it sent to you by next-day delivery.\n\nBuying from Silencer Central is the easiest way to buy a silencer, and it\u2019s the closest you can get to \u201cclick-and-ship\u201d online buying.\n\nHOW DO ATF EFORMS IMPACT THE BUYING PROCESS?\n\nATF eForms make the suppressor buying process easier and faster. Everything can be done online and there\u2019s no more snail mail involved. This means that approvals from the ATF will be much faster than the 15 months or so that it has taken in the past.\n\nCAN I HUNT WITH MY SUPPRESSOR?\n\nHunting is legal in 41 of the 42 states where suppressors are legal, and there are a lot of reasons why you should hunt with one so long as it\u2019s legal for you to do so. The one where you can own but not hunt with a suppressor is Connecticut.\n\nCAN I USE ONE SILENCER FOR MULTIPLE FIREARMS?\n\nThe short answer is yes, you can use one silencer for multiple firearms. However, different suppressors are rated for different calibers, so be sure to read the description of the suppressor before you shoot the wrong caliber through your silencer.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "aa2bd2b3-41d2-4c11-8f5f-3173c7d5393f": {"__data__": {"id_": "aa2bd2b3-41d2-4c11-8f5f-3173c7d5393f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "scrape.txt", "file_name": "scrape.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 334689, "creation_date": "2024-07-10", "last_modified_date": "2024-07-02", "last_accessed_date": "2024-07-11"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "bd6b66b4-bb19-4515-b495-19f42d286bba", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "scrape.txt", "file_name": "scrape.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 334689, "creation_date": "2024-07-10", "last_modified_date": "2024-07-02", "last_accessed_date": "2024-07-11"}, "hash": "a7aaa12b0a6af5d4e7255e2fbb753b03068b049f0a6ab8d9a6ce618ad0c97590", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "5bed1293-cf56-4caa-86ae-019ac141580a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "scrape.txt", "file_name": "scrape.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 334689, "creation_date": "2024-07-10", "last_modified_date": "2024-07-02", "last_accessed_date": "2024-07-11"}, "hash": "a2f0035647bebfa7f9346912f5efa7ccd75f100a25dafee3de9944b293383d70", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "032a83d0-281f-4bba-9e56-7069c887ce69", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "scrape.txt", "file_name": "scrape.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 334689, "creation_date": "2024-07-10", "last_modified_date": "2024-07-02", "last_accessed_date": "2024-07-11"}, "hash": "ec873b4aef524d9f7752e1fbcba27e4ecbc75f95f4900e28299e72a560c224c9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "510b7961d3137c789410251a1f96904ce967944fdb7b48ffbefffa20616a9ace", "text": "ATF eForms make the suppressor buying process easier and faster.

Not only can you damage the silencer and your gun, but you can also hurt yourself that way.\n\nDO I NEED TO HAVE A CLASS 3 LICENSE IN ORDER TO PURCHASE A SUPPRESSOR?\n\nBelieve it or not, there really is no such thing as a \u201cClass 3 License.\u201d That term is derived from a Class 3 SOT, which is part of the licensing you need in order to sell a suppressor. So, no, you don\u2019t need a Class 3 License to purchase a suppressor.\n\nHOW WILL YOU ship MY SUPPRESSOR?\n\nThis is one of the coolest benefits of buying a suppressor from Silencer Central.
